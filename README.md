# State-of-the-Art-Technology

This is the repository for the course State of the Art Technology I am taking at my MA Data Driven Design. 

The files in this repository can be used to generate song lyrics. 

The different experiments and iterations of the course can all be found here but the finished product which can also be used for 
generating lyrics can be found on https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1JJGP9HwSsWsd3q5CKtC6d9fnuxe7r-Xt?usp=sharing
