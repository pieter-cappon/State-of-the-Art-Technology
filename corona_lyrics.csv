125,Robyn,"Somebody said you got a new friend Does she love you better than I can? It's a big black sky over my town I know where you at, I bet she's around  Yeah, I know it's stupid, I just gotta see it for myself  I'm in the corner, watching you kiss her, ooh I'm right over here, why can't you see me? Ooh I'm giving it my all But I'm not the girl you're taking home, ooh I keep dancing on my own (I keep dancing on my own)  I'm just gonna dance all night I'm all messed up, I'm so outta line Stilettos and broken bottles I'm spinning around in circles  I'm in the corner, watching you kiss her, ooh I'm right over here, why can't you see me? Ooh I'm giving it my all But I'm not the girl you're taking home, ooh I keep dancing on my own I keep dancing on my own  So far away, but still so near (The lights go on, the music dies) But you don't see me standing here (I just came to say goodbye)  I'm in the corner, watching you kiss her, ohh I'm right over here, why can't you see me? Ooh I'm giving it my all But I'm not the girl you're taking home, ooo I keep dancing on my own I keep dancing on my own I'm in the corner, watching you kiss her, ohh I'm right over here, why can't you see me? Ooh I'm giving it my all But I'm not the girl you're taking home, ooo I keep dancing on my own I keep dancing on my own  I keep dancing on my own",Dancing On My Own
126,John Mayer,Check your pulse It's proof that you're not listening to The call your life's been issuing you The rhythm of a line of idle days  Scared of a world outside you should go explore Pull all the shades and wander the great indoors The great indoors  Lamplight makes the shadows play And posters take the walls away The TV is your window pane The view won't let you down So put your faith in a late night show I bet you didn't even know Depends on how far out you go The channel numbers change  Scared of a world outside you should go explore Pull all the shades and wander the great indoors The great indoors  Though lately I can't blame you I have seen the world And sometimes wish your room had room for two So go unlock the door And find what you are here for Leave the great indoors Leave the great indoors  Check your pulse It's proof that you're not listening to The call your life's been issuing you The rhythm of a line of idle days,Great Indoors

128,Green Day,"Summer has come and passed, the innocent can never last Wake me up when September ends Like my father's come to pass, seven years has gone so fast Wake me up when September ends  Here comes the rain again falling from the stars Drenched in my pain again, becoming who we are As my memory rests, but never forgets what I lost Wake me up when September ends  Summer has come and passed, the innocent can never last Wake me up when September ends Ring out the bells again, like we did when spring began Wake me up when September ends  Here comes the rain again, falling from the stars Drenched in my pain again, becoming who we are As my memory rests, but never forgets what I lost Wake me up when September ends   Summer has come and passed, the innocent can never last Wake me up when September ends Like my father's come to pass, twenty years has gone so fast Wake me up when September ends Wake me up when September ends Wake me up when September ends...",Wake Me up When September Ends
