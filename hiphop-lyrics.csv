i-mma-break-it-down,2002,eazy-e,Hip-Hop,"My eternal jam is the juice of the radio
Takin' out profanity, so they can play it though
Listen to a hell of a kick and the high hat
Going to the record store say ya gonna buy
That the E is connected to the A and the Z ya say Y
So that's how the beats stack it up on material made of hits
Takin' my time of Eastline to make sure it fit
Push play on the instrumental that's recorded
Step on stage and I'm suddenly awarded
Some sort of track appeared like a plaque
And some hell of a screen from the girls in the back
Takin' a bow 'cause I got style
Never at the bottom of the ways on the top of the pile
Yo it's Eazy on top even though I'm short
Guaranteed to help when I walk on the court
So get up make some noise for the gangsta clap
Gonna tip the laugh I'm not a pranksta
I'm serious Dre my sounds
So quit playin' around
'Cause I'mma break it down
Last time I was takin' my time with this
But other suckaz were makin' a rhyme with this
I had to change the tip or make it hyper
But they was rotten, I was gettin' riper
Ready to go, like never before
Givin' you more because I'm ready to score
Ren is my buddy you can tell I said often
Helpin' me destroy the suckaz that's softin'
Curin' diseases, my rhyme pleases, throw it a key
Balls havin' seasons, this is a doc trim
And I'm locked in, and I made up my mind
And I think I'm gonna rock then
You got beaches chill and I'mma push ya
To freeze after I'll cut ya 'cause I'mma butcher
And say ya have pricin' and then out ya go
'Cause a percentage on point bellys are very low
Messin' with a gun but once ya get hurt
Like a said before ya get rushed to the dirt
I'm not a law man, but I'mma raw man
But ya the dopiest one I ever saw man
I keep droppin' it pound for pound
And when I'm on the mic I always throw down
To keep y'all dancin' to my funky sound
So listen now, 'cause I'mma break it down
Now look at me and not the poster
And you could see right off I got the most of
The talent, experience or a trade
And complements for the rhyme that's made
Talks over today if this one so
Pick another artist and dis one
I got the ballet of the chosen vote
'Cause I don't need water to clear my throat
Comin' from the rain the show is like dancin'
Nasty like and the girls are like glancin'
Wantin' to get wit' me this routine
Keepin' it sprung still stayin' mean
Can ya dis this man I don't think so
Once I start writin' the way I let the ink go
Comin' out with songs like hit after hit
'Cause this is legit and yours ain't shit
Makin' it sound so dope 'cause I'm a genius
But your amazed with ya happy to see this
Brother go crazy on wax
Flowin' away like if I was on a sax
Doin' a solo in the shade I'm a spotlight, relax and chill
While your uptight pumpin' up the funky sounds
Yo you should know it's kinda persist
That the E is gonna break it down"
eazy-chapter-8-verse-10,2002,eazy-e,Hip-Hop,"(Alright Go)
This comes from the E Chapter 8 verse 10 and it reads
Its time to put some niggaz in check
When you shoot a gun,hot shells eject
Catch'em they get used as evidence
Only when they get brushed for finger prints
You ask Why am I like this?
'cause you wanna hear about shit like this
So I tell it,how I know it,Just hope the fuck I dont show it
Niggaz out frontn ,lottering and looting.
Lets recreate a drive by shooting
More brothers in a car blocks away
Waiting to spray, shotgun,Mack10 and an AK
They roll thru to a line of nigga's
It was 9 just like tha fuck they figured
Go around tha corner come back real slow
Lights off,cars in neutral,rolln at a snails pace and creepn
Hoping to catch all of them sleepn,a so called gang,drugs and sex (NWA)
Start busting a cap and all tha others jet,3 of'em fall to their doom
Pronounced dead at the scence,with gun shot wounds
3 dead 'cause Compton is scanless.
I'd like to tell ya brother, Ashes to Ashes,Dust to Dust (Amen)
daaaaaaaaa,daaaaaaa,daaaaaaa
(You will now witness tha sound of ??)(We will now pass around tha hat)
(thats good enough)No it aint,you fucked up, you fucked up (its cool) no
it aint"

Eazy muthafuckin' E
With the chrome to your dome
Cruisin' in my '64 rag top
I got a lot of juice
A lot of fuckin' block
Now when I hit that switch I'm bouncin'
More bounce to the ounce
And I'm clownin'
Keep the gat in my lap
'cause I'm fully strapped
For the car jackers
Fuck no hapsters
I pack a Tech-9
Plus a AK-47
Send a one way ticket to my hell
Or maybe heaven, peep
Nigga I don't sleep
Burry muthafuckas in the concrete
You try creep kinda slow in a Astro
But I peep you niggas out in my left window
So I blast and I blast til I blast no mo
Yo, they call a muthafucka John Doe
[Chorus] x 4
'cause when I hit that switch I'm bouncin'
More bounce to the ounce

Straight callin' my city
Niggas be winnin' and gettin' busy
Wit a tizy
Through my city
Chalk lines hang
Niggas bang
Chevy's swang like it ain't no thang
The gangs bang
So nigga tuck your chain
And try to buck this thang
End up gettin' one stuck in you brain
To refrain from this game of stressin'
Smokin' on water
And fin to bang your daughter
All up in the Best Western
She like the way that my '64 hop
Drop the top
Grab a rock
Now she's givin' me top
Non stop on the all row seat
Like the made me screen
So I two-wayed my nigga Eazy-E
[Chorus] x 4
[Eazy-E]
Old nigga E still cruisin'
Punk stay up on the nuts and the bone
Pussy nigga had beef knocked out of his teeth
The muthafucka should have stayed his ass home
Hey yo peep them bitchez in the Honda
4 deep with the proper ass sounds
Now every time that I meet a fine cute bitch
She got a friend from the fuckin' Dog Pound
Hey yo bitch
Here's the seven digits
Call me if you can
Only if you want it
Let a nigga know
Can I dig like a minor, 49er
Diggin' for gold from behind her
Watch this nigga do some diggin'
Pop that pussy on a platter
Watch this nigga do some diggin'
It's so tight it doesn't matter
YO!

Ruthless gangsta, definition villain,
Leave your shit unlocked and he's stealin',
So call tha police cause that's all you could do but,
He'll get away without leavin' a clue.

Ruthless gangsta, definition villain,
Leave your shit unlocked and he's stealin',
So call tha police cause that's all you could do but,
He'll get away without leavin' a clue.
Keepin' shit in control like the neighboorhood chief but,
Referred to as a walking thief,
They say he's a bad influence for the kids on the block,
Why the fuck they blamin' him,
He's the one that they jock.
Keepin' niggaz in line,
Whoever fucks with his rhyme,
And before you fuck with him,
You gotta fuck with his nine.
Not scared to pull the trigger on a punk ass nigga,
(A nigga) He could whoop his ass cause he's bigger.
Size don't mean shit,
He's from the old school fool,
He's a villain from the streets,
And he's supposed to rule,
Not sayin' he's in shit,
But he's down for mine,
He was put on the streets to keep niggaz in line.
Never givin' a fuck,
(huh?)
Because I know that he's a nigga that you want to be.
He can't help it he's in shit,
But he don't hold shit back,
He's a gangsta in black,
And he's about to attack.
[Eazy-E]
Cause I'm a ruthless villain,
Cold tearin' shit up,
Don't come on my face,
Pumpin' no kind of junk,

I'll smoke you like that,
And won't give a fuck.

Ruthless gangsta, definition villain,
You can lock up yo' shit,
He's Still Stealin',
Gettin' respect,
Cause the boy kicks butt,
But the real meaning is,
He don't give a fuck,
It's Eazy-E in the crowd,
But he's not in the 4,
I tell his money flow,
As he collects from his ho',
All expenses paid,
For the rhymes that he made,
Got the trophys in the house,
For the girls that he laid.
Not a wimp he's a pimp,
Now of course he's the boss,
So keep your bitch out his face,
Or else she's gonna get tossed.
The hard to be fucked with,
The boy got heart,
Wanna fuck with him,
He'll Rip your head apart.
Gangsta Gangsta,
That's what they yellin'
But him with his gangsta stroll,
He keeps bailin'.
Wherever he goes,
There's no discussion but silence.
They say that he's the one,
Promotin' gang violence,
That's a lie just a critic,
All that whack bullshit,
So let me tell you motherfuckers,
Who you fuckin' with,

Cause I'm a ruthless villain,
Cold tearin' shit up,
Don't come on my face,
Pumpin' no kind of junk,

ruthless-life,2002,eazy-e,Hip-Hop,"Chorus: X2
The saga continues right before your eyes
The saga continues cause its do or die
The saga continues right before your eyes
You know why? (why?)
Cause I'm ruthless for life
Nigga ten years passed and we still up in that ass
Will I make it or continue and
Look at all the s**t you in
Eazy does it like happy like the s**t we used to do
5 niggaz comin' out the C-P-T so f**k you
Time changed for the good
Niggaz in the hood be comin' up feel it
Can you set it off, for again, you know you should
Yo let's that this s**t back
To 1989
Where this nigga shoot and bust and niggaz know they couldn't find
Dream Team lovers
Egyptian fan base
Feelin' on the scene, all the fools got erased
Threw a mothaf**kin' monkey wrench up in the rap game
Since I hooked up with E, s**t ain't ever been the same
Opened up doors for the niggaz that be thinkin
that your flows be on tizight
Bitin' what I wrizite
Jokin' when I recite
Feelin' manuscripts
When I MC, if it ain't rough it ain't me
Chorus X2
Yo mothaf**kin' G'z, nigga like Eric Wright
You can floss for your b***h, but you know this s**t is tight
Cause when y'all niggaz started rappin', who'd you try and be?
I'ma slap you cause you lying, if you don't be sayin' me
Or the other 3, that the FBI be phone tappin'
Shoot the government before you niggaz started rappin'
Now its ? city, I gotta bomb it like Iraq
Use my alias, spend my nights at the shack
Ruthless attack all the way to two thou
Try to block it out, but you never knew how
And when I walk through the crowd
I'm seeing mothaf**ka's bread
I hear their b***hes sayin' ask MC Ren
Makin' fools sway when I roll to King Tet's
Because I started cussin' all you fools gettin' checks
Ruthless for life, see that be my state of mind
Y'all can kiss my black ass one more time
Chorus X2
I run a hundred miles just so I can MC
Villian want that bomb so I get with L.T.
Ain't nothin' changed
We find 'em, f**k 'em, then flee
While you hatin', pillow talkin', with that b***h, she want me
Niggaz weed crazy, Dre and Snoop turned you out
Now y'all cristal sippin', y'all niggaz be trippin'
Make the West look like ass, all full of s**t
Invest in drug money, s**t, still gettin' in
What it take for y'all quit
Ruthless got it on lock
Y'all shootin' videos tryin' to look like Pac
Here we come, here we come, blowin' up your spot
My little brother Jubee and the big homie Rock
Full circle, all this s**t gon' repeat
When this s**t drop, niggaz clownin' in the streets
The saga continues right before your eyes
Who really gives a f**k?
Cause this is ruthless for life

still-talkin,2002,eazy-e,Hip-Hop,"Good evening, and welcome to eazy's playhouse
You stupid muthafucka
Now that you got the album
What the fuck are you gonna do with it
Bitch
Easily I approach
The microphone because I ain't no joke
Tell your momma to get off of my tip
I have no time to give her my dick
I'm gonna hold it, and walk around the stage and
If you fuck up I'm goin' to get my gauge and
Unload the barrel and laugh
'cause I'm puttin' lead in your mothafuckin' ass
Psychopathic, but the hoes are attracted
Because when I'm on hard, my dick's at least a yard
In the days of old, I was a nut
Now I need at least 3 hoes when I fuck
'cause I do a check, nut 1 nut 2
Then I save a nut for when there's nothin' else to do
Get used to the crew, bitch, cause I would never quit
As soon as you think that's it I'm still talkin' shit
I told you that nigga was crazy
E boy, that's my boy, godamnit
I got a fable that you need to listen to
It's a funky little rhyme about a bitch or a two
One's sharon and the other one shaun
I want to nut but which one do I want?
Shaun said eazy let me fuck you blind
And sharon said e I want to blow your mind
I said fuck it, I know what should be done
Just pull your panties down and I'll fuck the biggest one
And then I get the
Other pussy put it in the freezer
So I can always have a on-hold skeezer
Yeah that's the ticket, I'll do it like that
So I told the hoes to take a big step back
Took the zipper down, eyes wide, and said
Here's what I'm gonna put inside
Grab it like a rabbit, grab it let's work it
But I won't love you when I'm done I'd still be talkin' shit ...
That boy'z good
Yeah that boy's good
That mothafucka'z talkin' all kinds of shit
I used to get pussy like eazy eric every day
You're mothafuckin' lyin'
How you know I'm mothafuckin' lyin'?
You're lyin', your dick can't get hard ..
Oh, suck my dick mothafucka
Nigga you lied
Who you're talkin' to..?
Wait a minute, wait a minute, cut that shit
Hey yo yella boy! wantcha rewind it!
Niggas don't see I'm a 100% legit
And you know it ain't about all that bullshit
It's about fuckin' this bitch and that bitch
But not the bitch with the 7 day itch, like that ho'
Just throwin' me the pussy
She says she wants to do it like a doggy
She's bad, nobody is badder
But she got more crabs than a seafood platter
Bitch on the gank move, to skeaze me
Just to say ""I got fucked by eazy""
So I slapped the ho' like a pimp
Oi might be a woman-beater but I'm not a pussy-eater
So when the shit hits the fan, it's outta my mouth
You don't like what I'm talkin' about?
All of ya'll can just suck my dick
You can quote me now cause I'm still talkin' shit
The boy's good, I told you the boy's good
The nigga has talent
You don't know a damn thing
Yeah, I like that part, bring that shit back one more time, maestro
That's that old z.z. hill, huh?
I can do the mashed potato nigga, what can you do?
I can do the bugaloo
Bugaloo!? that old shit been played out since 1967

like a bird I'm havin' evil thoughts
a black hood covers my face
and death flows through my mind at it's own pace
sometimes I feel like a super hero
urgin' to free my kind
I'm so accurate
I shoot ya heart with a dime
now I'm back to the moral of my tale
I see a victim, and then my thoughts fail
my mind is still fumblin' with the present slavery
I'm here to save you but who's to save me
I hold my strap so long that my palms are all wet
I put finger on the button and then the sight'll check
I make the kill here's the deal
after the trigger's pulled then the death is sealed
so as the shots sing out like a piper
everyones scared of a neighborhood sniper

So my boy is a snitch
I put my gun up to his head
and simply scared the bitch boo
being the E ya know I'm thinkin' devious thoughts
take off ya clothes nigga and here comes a plot
his bitch was scared she made a move I pulled the trigger
now the room is red
now there's nothing left but the snitch
here's a four leaf clover punk make a wish
one [*Shot*] two [*Shot*] three strikes your out
this nigga is dead and now I'm lookin' for a window to get out
I made my escape the cops chase
duck into an alley so they don't recognize my face
the boy had to pay the piper
so they all stay in debt of a neighborhood sniper

I'm Doin' dirt by myself as I continue my mission
killin' all fools as an addiction
as the E lovin' the game leavin the shame
and in my heart I feel no muthafuckin' pain
because my heart is cold as I was told
and with the AK-47 I stand bold
rippin' up shit with the fury of my gun shot
pop pop pow as I watch the muthafucka drop
lovin' the sight as the blood spills
take a photograph, to keep in my hall of thrills I'm stayin' calm
and never hyper as I succeed in my mission
of bein' a neighborhood sniper

Niggaz all getting drunk, and smoking a bum bud
Oh wait here's a punk, pump the trunk
'cause it's a gang of jackers in the front smoking
All the hump, some shit was said about blue and red
But I'm color blind and I gotta nine
Threw up the sign I cock the 9, I cock the 9.
Well nigga pop the 9and let it holla
Test drive wit a neighborhood's scholar
Black Impaler, blue chucks on gettin outta
Sucks on hip hop thugsta get the fuck on
Niggaz looking shifty, do they want to diss me, lick me
Show me love or peel my cap quickly
My six sense won't let me slip don't puff wit the draggin' 'em
I'm still toe taggin em, hit the spot wit a don still baggin' 'em
It's the low call, S.A.B on the vocal, blast my way out eazy pay
The way, all you bitch niggaz stay out
[Chorus: x2]
I cock the 9, I cock the 9, I cock the 9 ( and everything is fine)
I cock the 9, I cock the 9, I cock the 9 (my homey pop the 9)
I cock the 9, I cock the 9, I cock the 9
I cock the 9, I cock the 9, I cock the 9 (my homey pop the 9)
It's like dice game, dice game niggaz get they roll'on
Everything's all good till niggaz getting sold on
Here we all get together and shoot, fuck
I grab my gun then I picked up my loot
But I didn't lose shit so it's all good
Leavin pumpin Eazy-E ""Boyz n the Hood""
'cause I'm a gangsta so I can relate, most of these
Niggaz is fake and tryin to hate
I put a buster in his place, I put one in his face
Obey my first and give him the taste
That's how I does it, that's how I do it
And the murder weapon that I use you know I threw it
He kept persuading so I had to do it, 'uh' play
For keeps that's the rule of the streets 'uh'.
Dick Tracy all on my nuttz like Cagny and Lacy
And don't faze me, Ruthless is the label that pays me
But this one H.K weighs a ton, words are yellow wit
The ? freaks on a run, bring ya condom in the kingdom
Huh ho from the ceilin to the floor, info red at ya window
Plus the E go hangin out the beamer tho
Drop shit like a seagull, for the people
Ho's make a contribution, but y'all don't hear me tho.
[Chorus: x2]
Tuck ya legs to my dick with the wrap em real tight
Just encase its on and a nigga gotta fight, an a
Nigga gotta bust, but who in the fuck said in god we trust
The shit went down everybody start runnin'
Bitches screamin' and the bullets still comin'
Run into a nigga tryin' to save mine, reach for my gun ah shit!

Three pounds of indo
Two birds of cocaine

Living a lie, I gotta get that money
I'll be damned if I'm bummy
Gotta watch my back around these niggas cause they funny
20 years of watching my mama's tears got my heated, heavily weeded
Smoking that bong cause I need it
These niggas don't want me balling, they want me buried
Bogged in the dirt from shots flurried
Laying with bugs under my shirt
I got plans to hop up in that Hummer
Cause I'm a stunner, I sit back and wonder
When them angels gonna call my number under
My chest is a heart of a lion
I ain't lying, bounty hunters got me flying
With my iron, high as a giant
I'm running from nothing, my stomach is touching what I'm clutching
To give you more than a concussion, end of discussion

Look in the mirror, I see a soldier

In these beanies and these rags living fantasies
Fronting like it's all fun and games 'til the shoot 'em up bang
And you see your brains hang and you see we ain't playing
Ain't saying we ain't laying down at night and ain't praying

Man, I'm done saying that I'm done playing

And not lash back out at 'em, please

You wanna see Marshall? I'll show you Marshall
I try to show you art, but you just pick it apart
So I see I have to start, showing you fucking old farts

Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
Girl, It's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me girl?
If I fell off tomorrow would you still love me?
If I didn't smell so good would you still hug me?
If I got locked up and sentenced to a quarter century,
Could I count on you to be there to support me mentally?
If I went back to a hoopty from a Benz, would you poof and disappear like
Some of my friends?
If I was hit and I was hurt would you be by my side?
If it was time to put in work would you be down to ride?
I'd get out and peel a nigga cap and chill and drive
I'm asking questions to find out how you feel inside
If I ain't rap 'cause I flipped burgers at Burger King
Would you be ashamed to tell your friends you feelin' me?
In the bed if I used my tongue would you like that?
If I wrote you a love letter would you write back?
Now we can have a lil' drink you know a nightcap
And we could go do what you like, I know you like that

Are you my soul mate? 'Cause if so, girl you a blessing
Do you trust me enough, to tell me your dreams?
I'm staring at ya' trying to figure how you got in them jeans
If I was down would you say things to make me smile?
I treat you how you want to be treated just teach me how
If I was with some other chick and someone happened to see?
And when you asked me about it I said it wasn't me
Would you believe me? Or up and leave me?
How deep is our bond if that's all it takes for you to be gone?
We only humans girl we make mistakes, to make it up I do whatever it take

hate-it-or-love-it-g-unit-remix,2005,50-cent,Hip-Hop,"Coming up I was confused, my mommy kissing a girl
Confusion occurs coming up in the cold world
Daddy ain't around, probably out committing felonies
My favorite rapper used to sing, ""Check check out My Melody""
I wanna live good, so shit I sell dope
For a four finger ring, one of them gold ropes
Nana told me if I passed I'd get a sheepskin coat
If I can move a few packs I'd get the hat, now that'd be dope
Tossed and turned in my sleep that night
Woke up the next mornin, niggas had stole my bike
Different day, same shit, ain't nothing good in the hood
I'd run away from this bitch and never come back if I could
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop
(Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me)
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop
(Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me)
(G-G-G-G-G-Unit!) On the grill of my lowrider
Guns on both sides, right above the gold wires
I'll fo'-five 'em, kill a nigga on my song
And really do it, that's the true meaning of a ghostwriter
Ten G's 'll take your daughter out of Air Forces
Believe you me homey, I know all about losses
I'm from Compton, wear the wrong colors, be cautious
One phone call'll have your body dumped in Marcy
I stay strapped like car seats, been banging
Since my lil' nigga Rob got killed for his Barkleys
That's ten years, I told Pooh in ninety-five
I'll kill you if you try me for my Air Max 95's
Told Banks when I met him I'mma ride
And if I gotta die, I'd rather homicide
I ain't have 50 cent when my grandmama died
Now I'm going back to Cali with my Jacob on
See how time fly?
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop
(Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me)
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop
(Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me)
From the beginning to the end, losers lose
Winners win this is real we ain't got to pretend
The cold world that we in, is full of pressure and pain
Enough of me nigga now listen to Game
Used to see Five-O, throw the crack by the bench
Now I'm fuckin' with 5-0, it's all starting to make sense
My moms happy, she ain't gotta pay the rent
And she got a red bow on that brand new Benz
Waiting on Sha Money to land, sitting in the Range
Thinking how they spent 30 million dollars on airplanes
When there's kids starving
Pac is gone and Brenda still throwing babies in the garbage
I wanna know ""What's Going On"" like I hear Marvin
No schoolbooks, they used that wood to build coffins
Whenever I'm in the booth and I get exhausted
I think what if Marie Baker got that abortion?
I love you ma
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop

i-dont-need-em,2005,50-cent,Hip-Hop,"Yeah
It is what it is man
Sirens flashin', you know the routine, the crime scene taped off
It started out a robbery, they blew half his face off
They seen him shinin', course full of diamonds he bought
Grindin', his foot slipped off the ladder of success he was climbin'
The D's came through, asked the niggas if they knew what happened
Somehow my name end up in anything that involves clappin'
Detectives at my mama crib, they say they wanna question me
They put me in a line up last time and they arrested me
When it come to cookin' coke, they know I got the recipe
I turn a quarter to a half, that's why they mess with me
I'm the neighborhood pusher, I move packs to make stacks
A little weed, a little X, a little H, a little crack
Figure, I push it to the limit, take this shit to the max
Navy blue vest on, navy blue Yankee hat
Calm, in my palm, fully loaded fire arm
First to let off, last to run, every time its on
I tell niggas to suck my dick
Get the fuck out my face 'cause I don't need 'em
'Cause they're never around when I'm down
Shot and I'm bleedin'
What, niggas yeah
Is there a mothafuckin' problem nigga
Oh yeah that's what I thought so, pussy
Niggas be talkin' about me, they always callin' me crazy
Fuck them O.G. niggas, they stuck in the eighties
Sayin' they gonna do me somethin', now you know that's a lie
Nigga you look at me wrong, I'll let that hammer fly
I'm rich, I still wake up with crime on my mind
Queens nigga put it down like Pappy Mason in his prime
When I say move, nigga move or get caught in the cross fire
Up a fence runnin', cut my fuckin' hand on a barb wire
Shits crazy, just a different day, its the same shit
Hollow tip part in ya head, leave ya whole fuckin' brain split
They sit, they see me in the Ashton Martin
What's the matter, they can't get that hoopty started
Thought they was grindin', well goddamn where that money at
Thought you was fucked, 'cause you was lettin' paper stack
You ain't a hustler, matter of fact, yous a busta
I don't trust ya, I should a sent niggas to touch ya
I tell niggas to suck my dick
Get the fuck out my face 'cause I don't need 'em
'Cause they're never around when I'm down
Shot and I'm bleedin'
What?
Who said they gonna do somethin' to me
You must be out your rabid ass mind
Fuck around and kill one of these niggas"

God gave me style
God gave me grace
God gave me style
God gave me grace
God put a smile on my face
God put this smile on my face
God made me shine like the sun
God make me shine like the sun
Sometimes I feel like I'm the one
Sometimes I feel like I'm the one
It ain't my fault
I just reach for style, I'm hot I breaks it down
It ain't my fault, you can't break it down the way I break it down
Listen you can call me what you want, black and ugly
But you can't convince me the Lord don't love me
When my cds drop, they sell the best
You call it luck, why can't it just be I'm blessed
I'm a trackstar, runnin' through life, chasin' my dream
? I may even trade in a mic in for a triple beam
I zone off thinkin' is there really heaven or hell
So what happens to a changed man who dies in a cell
I need no answers to these questions, 'cause time will tell
Got a date with destiny, she's more than a girl
Don't much good come from me, but my music
Is a gift given from God so I'ma use it (Yeah!)
[Chorus]
I just reach for style, I'm hot I breaks it down
It ain't my fault, you can't break it down the way I break it down
Some days, I'm in the crowd all by myself
Bunch of niggas around I'm still by myself
I'm drink off in the crowd, by myself
Thinkin' bout nothin' more than life, what else
These days its hard to tell who really cares for me
So you when hear this song, you should say a prayer for me
I put a message in my music, hope it brightens your day
If times are hard, when you hear it, know you'll be okay
A O.G. told me God's favorites have a hard time
You out the hood, that's good now stay on the grind
I'm a spunge, knowledge and wisdom, my ? off fast
I'm in a class by myself, you do the math

On the beach or in the park, it's whatever you into

I ain't finished teaching you 'bout how sprung I got ya
Wanna show me how you work it baby? No problem, get on top
Then get your bounce around, like a little rider

Are just between me and you, yeah, oh yeah
Give it to me baby, nice and slow
Climb on the top, ride like you in a rodeo
You ain't never heard a sound like this before
'Cause I ain't never put it down like this
As soon as I come through the door, she get to pulling on my zipper
It's like it's a race who could get undressed quicker
Isn't it ironic how erotic it is to watch 'em in thongs?
Had me thinking 'bout that ass after I'm gone
I touch the right spot at the right time
Lights on, or lights off, she like it from behind
So seductive you should see the way she whine
Her hips in slow mo' on the floor when we grind
Long as she ain't stopping, homie I ain't stopping
Dripping wet with sweat, man it's on and popping
All my champagne campaign, bottle after bottle, it's on
And we gon' sip 'til every bubble in every bottle is gone
I'll take you to the candy shop

I'm the biggest crook from New York since son of Sam
Cruisin', bumpin' Bugz shit, rueger in my hand
Thinkin' the east ain't enough, its time to expand
I plan to head out west and plant my feet down
A nigga big as King Kong in the street now
I do a lil house shoppin', and buy me a crib
Its palm trees and pretty bitches out in Cali kid
I touched the Hollywood paper, go and shoot me some flicks
Have some supermodel bitches come and suck on my dick
My mom turn in her grave if I married a white chick
But becky'll suck the chrome off a Chevy and shit
Niggas be wearin' fake shines, I'm rockin' a lil charm
Thirty carrots on the pinky, kiss the ring on the Don
Crack open that Cali bud, stuff the weed in the bomb

Nigga you hustle, but me I hustle harder
I got what you need, them trees, that heart, that powder
My niggas we G packs, every hour on the hour
They shoot when I say shoot, so I'm in the position of power
You fuck around if you want to
Where I'm from, you learn to blend in, or get touched
I don't need niggas for support, I don't walk with a crutch
Niggas know my stage, they don't fuck with me son
You got an appetite for hollow-tips, I'll feed you my gun
This is that ferrari F-50 shit, its real laid back
Type shit you recline to in the Maybach
I got two shooters now, on the run from the fuzz
You get the same shit for ten bodies,as you get for one 'cause
I live life in the fast lane, 100 miles an hour, chrome and some wood grain
You know a nigga still really tryna move cane
Make a lil extra money on the side mayn
I ain't playin', I'm up early with the birds work
Puttin' that work in, pirrelli's on the Porsche chirpin'
I got a hundred mill from music, a hundred grand from crack

Get hit with a K round, ya ass ain't gon' make it
You niggas goin' get laid out in blood and ya brains out
Have you on the concrete, shiverin' and shakin'
I'm from Southside motherfucker, where the gats explode
If you feel like you on fire, boy drop and roll

Carve ya ass up nice, you play me like a punk

In my hood
Niggas might buck at me, so I keep somethin' around to buck back
In my hood
I don't trust a mothafuckin' soul when the D's come they fool
On my first case they told, where I'm from it ain't safe
To have more than a eighth, niggas'll come to your place
Put a gun in your face, tell ya open the safe
As your heart starts to race cause a robbery could turn into a homo-case
Co-opperate or Doc will have to op-porate, niggas will pop at you
Run the light, then pop at Jake, trust me son, niggas will go hard for that cake
These thirsty niggas will lurk, then you'll have to catch 'em and murk 'em
I'm observin' in my hood, these niggas be dumbin'

Well that's what you get for stuntin' on my block show off
You shit out of luck if niggas catch you slippin'
Crack money slow so you know niggas is trippin'
Shorty down there, on the Queens track takin' a whippin'
Shit, bitch get out a pocket, she needs some discipline
Peep the fiends, shootin' diesel in his arm in the alley
Look at the chrome spinners spinnin' on that black DeNali
The grimey niggas where I'm from, they want to see you chipped up

Matter fact I'd be on the next flight
Tryna get it on with you tonight
Do the things you like
Touch the right spot, have ya piped and hot
While the wind blow through your hair in the drop

You can go straight to sleep after its all over
In the mornin' roll over and we can start over

Yeah I called just to say hope you havin' a nice day
You're special, I get into you, oops I mean I'm into you
Every chance I get, I find time to spend with you
Jet to bring you to me, just to watch a movie
Better yet to watch you climb into the jacuzzi
Bubbles in the bath, don in the glass
Funny how time flies when you full of laughs
Its fun but before long, a nigga gotta dash
For the lifestyle I live, a nigga need cash
To come quick, so I don't fuck with the stash
I know you like pumps and boots
I like jeeps and coupes, so I grind all the time, just gimme some loot
I put a spell on you, I like to call it a spell
In the bedroom, workin' it well, I don't kiss and tell

Want to come test me, pussy boy don't try
Police responds, never fast enough, the shots fired
Don't be stupid, find out who you fuckin' wit son
'Fore we find out where ya bitch gets her hair and nails done
Its elementary, life is but a dream
You know row, row ya boat, your blood forms a stream
After you get hit, you should of thought about the shit

Sometimes, I sit and look at life from a different angle
Don't know if I'm God's child or I'm Satan's angel

I simply would of wished that my music would be a hit
Big said damn, niggas want to stick me for my paper
And pray for my downfall, I understand it all
But me, I'm a little more flashy a nigga
So chances are, I'ma have to blast me a nigga
I'm on that teflon vest shit, that wild wild west shit
And eighty one 1 carrot stones in my necklace
I shine so hard, I make motherfuckers want to kill me
Every projects and every hood I go, they feel me
Know it sounds like rap, but this shit is real be
I don't talk that rich shit, but nigga I'm filthy

I'll build you up
Listen if you let me, I'll be the reason you shine
Its a secret I want the world to know that you're mine
But on some real shit, communications could be better
So I'm writin' a song, instead of a love letter
They can play it on the radio, a hundred times a day
I figure when you hear it, you would stop and think of me
I want to get to know ya and be the reason you smile

When times are tough, tell me that I'm special
Not rap, I mean me, that I'm special
You know they say diamonds are a girl's best friend
Precious stones, could you put me before them
If so, I'll see to it that they always around
Nothin' but the best now, how does that sound
If I talk with you, when we talk you can keep it

Baby I'll build you up
Girl if I, never show I have you by my side
I build you up
Girl I need to know for sure you're mine
I need to know for sure
I think about you thinkin' that you feel the same way
Was it just my imagination again runnin' away
If you ready to ride girl come on let's roll
G-55 fly ma let's go
Its hard to measure the pleasure of havin' you in my present
Your smile makes me smile, I'll show you my style
We can shop a lil' bit, I pick out my shit
One pair at a time, till your shoe games sick
Now who knows what the future holds, we'll be together probably
For better or worst, like Whitney and Bobby
If you want to play house, we can play house then
But wait why pretend if you can move in
Before I be your buddy in bed, let me be your best friend
Girl, its more than lust, I want your trust
You keep it real with me, I'll keep it real with you
'Cause I know with you by my side, there's nothin' I can't do
Baby I'll build you up
Girl if I, never show I have you by my side
I build you up
Girl I need to know for sure you're mine
I need to know for sure

ryder-music,2005,50-cent,Hip-Hop,"Yeah
Yeah we can ride to this
Just lay back, crew
Here's a taste of my life, its bitter and sweet
I put my heart out to the sounds of the drums and the beat
I put my life on the line when I'm out on the street
Put my Teflon on and roll with my heat
I keep my circle nice and small, I don't fuck with these clown niggas
In a race for the cheese, I run laps around niggas
Soon as I step on stage, the crowd applauds
Soon as my sneaker wear in stores, Reebok start sore
I ain't gotta say I'm a boss, niggas can tell
The east coast crib, the size of a small hotel
The shit journalist write about me, get me confused
Have me feelin' like the heavy weight champ when he lose
I read somewhere, I'm homophobic shit
Go through the hood, there's mad niggas on my dick
Now we can get hostile or we can do this smooth
T&T; around, I can still make blow move
[Chorus: x2]
This is what you call ryder music
All the gangstas are ridin' to it
Let's roll, I can show ya how we do it
When we ride to that ryder music (let's go)
(Let's go)
Last year, I woke up, a good look, damn it feels good
On the low, I done fucked half of Hollywood
Had your favorite actress from your favorite shows
In my favorite position, you know how it goes
In my Bentley bumpin' Prince shit ""This is When Thugs Cry""
This is what it sounds like when hollow tip slugs fly
Homie, this is somethin' you can ride and smoke to
Stay on point, cause niggas will ride and smoke you
Jealousy's for women, but some niggas is bitch made
They make you want to run across they're head with a switch blade
They point their finger at me, sayin' I'm bug
My flows crack you listen, your fuckin' brains on drugs
Look, ice drippin' on my neck, hands grippin' on the tec
Fool trippin' through the set, you can get ya ass whipped
Cards missin' out my deck, screws loose show respect
You try to come at me kid, your ass better come correct
[Chorus: x2]
My mama gave birth to a winner, I gotta win
Pray to Lord, forgive me for my sins
Still thuggin', cruisin', rims gleamin'
Like the stones on my wrist
Zonin', guess this is how it feels to be rich
Homie, you hustlin' backwards if you chasin' a bitch
Stupid, chase the paper, they come with the shit
I'm fallin', in love with success
Entrepreneur, kinda sewer, I maneuver the best
Rowin', ruger on my lap, rubber grip on the handle
Stunt I'll have ya homies burn a rest in peace candle
As wise men speak, I listen and learn
A man dies, a baby's born, my niggas the world turns
Rappers, I make 'em sick when I say I'm the shit
They mistake my confidence for arrogance, they hate on the kid
In '99, I had a vision and made a decision
Bein' broke is against my religion, now picked up

Y'all niggas know (what what y'all niggas know what I'm about)
Y'all niggas know, find me at my do' when the guns come out
I do this all the time, stuck with a little shine
Walk with a little nine, case I get in a bind
They say I'm fuckin' crazy, they think I'm out my mind
Cause I'm down to bust a nigga head all the time
Now you know the hoes, they know how I roll
In that new Rolls with the suicide doors
22 inch chrome, a nigga money low
You try to touch me, I put out ya get ya brains blown
You go against the grain, pussy and you on ya own
You right there in my zone, welcome to the terridome
The ice blowin' my chain, blood blow in my veins
Blue still in the range, I'm doin' my thang
The semi auto spray, run if you get away
I'll find your whereabouts and clap at you another day
Nigga play with the bread, get a hole in ya head
You touch a dime of mine thug and your ass dead
[Chorus: x2]
In the hood, hoopty, hate low, niggas don't know I'm around
Hop out, hit 'em up, lay my murder game down
You see me in ya projects, 187's in progress
Hard niggas finna' soften up when that lead touch 'em
You cut 'em once and keep fight, fuck it just keep cuttin' em
Its real killa instinct, kill or be killed
Trust me, you don't want to feel how hollow tips feel
Fuck around and get ya cap peeled
Nigga you know the drill, Brownsville
Flat bush, ground heights, Brooklyn Zoo
Feed the wolves, they eat the food
And they ? fathom too
Nigga welcome to the jungle, New York New York
Gangstas who signed ??? actually let their guns talk
I'm cool with some bloods, I'm cool with some cripes
I'm cool but if there's a problem, I got extra clips
I don't know karate, but I split the bricks
I don't love 'em loverboy, we the shit bitch
[Chorus: x2]
I'll come through and touch ya, walk out then cut ya
In case your dumbass want to tussle
Are-15, co-exist to make the shell case muffle
Scope, ? run you're still dead
Hit your calf, hit your ass, hit ya back, then your head
Contract killer, murder for the scrilla
Search, find a nigga, run up behind a nigga
Shoot car windows out to flat line a nigga
Gun pop, heart stop, homie this is heavy
You on your way to meet your maker, nigga are you ready
No exception to the rule, death is promised
Plus I just bought my niggas new macs and llamas
Got respect for you, ? I will accommodate you
One phone call and niggas will exterminate you
No future fuckin' with me, there's no tomorrow
Niggas'll run up on you tonight and hit ya the hardest

You touch Shady I'll leave you dearly departed
Robin, Cagney or Lacey, it's 50 cent and Shady
The worst baby, put your hands on my peoples
I'll react crazy, put a hole through ya front and ya back maybe
But dude if you try me, I'll have ya ass hooked up to an IV
I'll leave no witnesses when I ride, be
You fuck with me, you see
I'll react like an animal, I'll tear you apart
If the masterpiece was murder, I'd make shit art
Niggas knew I wasn't wrapped too tight from start
But bein' a little off, landed me on top of the charts
So you take the good with the bad, I guess
Level three Teflon plate on my chest
And my cock back hollow tip in the chamber

And make ya aim there and squeeze

I said we're walkin' away, did you hear me you want to be thankful
That we ain't beefin' was to agree and just leave it at ""that""

Retaliation will be like that Muslim shi'ite ""attack""
Some where along the line, its like me and 50 made a ""pact""
He's got my back, I got his back, ""back""
It's almost like we're kinda like Siamese twins
Cause when we beef we pull each other in
So we'll do shit like we're conjoined at the hip
Its just unavoidable some of this shit is washable
And some shit will never boil up
And some of it will just simmer at best
If left at home, we'll let it be so there won't be no sit downs
The days that Zino, there will no peace discussions with me
There ain't gon' be no friendly debates over crumpets and tea
Just quit fuckin' with me and I'll gladly quit fuckin' with you

Now you trying to leave me, you'll never live without me
Girl, I'm missin' you, come and see me soon
Tie your arm up, put that lighter under that spoon
Now put that needle to ya arm princess, stick it in
Relapse you fat bitch, don't ever try that again
All that shit I did for you, I made you feel good
We have a love thing, you treatin' this like its just a fling
What we have is more sacred than a vow or a ring
You broke my heart, you dirty bitch I won't forget what you did

Over and over you hurt me, my love is unconditional
They talk to you when you up, you down they got nothin' to say
But when you call, I'll come runnin', I'll always take the pain away
They set you up, to let you down, they crowned you prom queen
Fiddle about me behind your back, they call you a fuckin' fiend
Can we just be alone, so I can kiss and hug you
Plus me beside you, no other man can loves you like I do
Call me daddy, I'll make you feel good, I mean real good
I found pleasure in pleasin' you, like a real man should
It was written long before, it was carved in a tree
Forever me and you baby we were meant to be

Now I lay thee down to sleep
Niggas tryin' to lay me down with heat
If I should die do' before I awake
I pray my Lord my soul to take
If dead men could talk in your sleep
And your homie told you who got him
Would you have the heart to shoot the nigga that shot him
Or would you start switchin' up?
You think about the penitentiary, your bitchin' up?
What if he said money ain't everything
The hood raised us wrong
What it takes to get your money long
But look I'm gone
Would that touch your heart have you feelin' funny inside
Would that be enough to make your punk ass ride
What if he gave you a li'l list of things to do
Said he wouldn't have to die, he could live through you
Would you load your gats and get ready ro ride
Or would you lock the door at your crib and hide
It's a cold world even when it's hot outside
Whether sunshine or rain, you still feel pain
Hit him 'cause he was your strength
Now you in a daze
Your homie turnin' over in his grave
'Cause you pussy
Ya know who killed him
Ya know who killed him
Ya know who killed him

Ya know who killed him
Ya know who killed him
Ya know who killed him

Them boys smoked your homie
You ain't gon' do nothin' back
Not even if he told you, you next to get clapped
It don't take much for them shells to make the best of you
Your peoples probably gon' cremate and burn the rest of you
You done did too much dirt to try and make it to heaven
Nigga, is you down for this 1 8 7
When you reach the pearly gates, how you gon' explain?
You gonna try and tell God you've been framed
Y'all did everything together, he was your dog
Now you uptown coppin' and he in the morgue
Them niggas he gave pacs to they kept the cake
His sister and baby momma talkin' to Jake
Da' niggas that rocked him they came to the wake
But they come inside, they sat out in the ride
At the funeral, homicide, all in the business
Walkin' 'round askin' niggas to tell 'em who did it
Niggas is throwin' blows, now you ready to rumble?
Thirsty niggas an animal, the hood is a jungle
Broke nigga, will body someone over a bundle
Man, a three year old kid in my hood know what a gun do
Ya know who killed him
Ya know who killed him
Ya know who killed him

Ya know who killed him

And I, shared the same dreams she had about cheddar

I got a thing for baby girls, me and her against the world

Get on top and let me see you work it girl

And if your body smell right, let me lick all them holes
I bust a nut in your face and wipe my dick on your clothes

Everybody wants to be real

TONY YAYO:
They say good things will happen to those who wait
Shorty stuck in the game still slingin' weight
None of that's yo' life that ten in the brown
For XL six or seven fo' pound
Suede seats is hot but Italian leather is better
And with camera's in the mirror nigga cars costs cheddar
I'm on first class flights with flying cooks
'cause my verse sound nice when they flyin' hooks
Now im blowin' weed-o in Beverly Hills
Some bad free hoes in the Montreal
Next year it's the new Hummer
Stash box with the llama drive through in the blue data bomba
Heaven or Hell will prevail when I'm a goner
'cause I Eat up tracks Like Hannibal and Dahma
I'm the first one out, and last one on the corner
This life is a hustle any day you be a goner
P89 Ruger with the silence off
Little clipper sellin' spitballs goin' through straws
We got plenty of rap sheets but not on sale
We even got dillingers that hold shotgun shells
These rappers is talkin' 'bout bricks in they rhymes
You never did shit but some Mickey Mouse crimes
I don't respect it my work is never watered down
So on the first I get more checks than Nike town
Swingin' 31 Money's I been on the block
Since nigga's did the snake runnin' man in the walk
When I was 15 I didn't want no workin papers
I worked the strip all night, servin' niggers
Listen nigga, We live like Italians in jail
I got CO's bringin' cell phones to my cell
Get rich in the game, niggas out to get you
Fill you ass up with led turn yo' ass to a pencil
I jumped out with the Ruger rapid fire
I had you on the run like Omar on the wire
I'm the only rapper you know that stay on the run
I'm the only rapper you know that stay with a gun
I'm a hustla' OG's love to hate
'cause I got old school money put away in a safe
You can catch me in the hood where that dope and coke at
Or you can catch me in cali in the Hollywood throwback
I'm a bail jumper, you know them fish scale pumper
Fuck judge wong he gon' catch me on the corner
Nigga make poor attacks, homie ya owe me
You wanna rap we can battle for yo' see through rollie
I begin in a mansion stripin' the models
The bathroom's so far you gotta piss in a bottle
There's too many Indians and not enough chiefs
Why you buy all the gun's if you ain't got enough peeps
The shit I spit will cause an all out riot
In my new 4 fifth will cause a hollow tip die
Im the type to tie up your lady, gun butt your baby
Im like the mob nigga fuck you pay me
Im'a hide my assets, and disappear
Make a quick 20 mil and vanish in thin air
I've finished my work now its time to cop
And meet that Chinese lady at the baggie spot
I Need 12 12's
And 58 58's

And they all gon' wait motherfucka

You ready to sell your soul? hahaha

You shoulda slayed me as a baby
Behavin' shadier than Wes Craven
And you ain't even gotta pay me
I take pleasure of layin' a nigga down daily
You face me, punk it's over, you'll faint fast
I've never fucked up to where I can't whoop ya ass
You'll neck'll get snapped with bare hands, fuck music
Is he rappin'? It's cool but fools, just don't confuse it
What happens: these dudes get rude then I lose it
I'm scandalous, I blow ya two niggas off the atlas
With a gat that's bigger than Godzilla's back nigga
You are not realer, in fact you're feel the effects
Of a crack dealer, why'all presidents since we smacked
And got a mack 10 with it, so I ain't gotta rap
But I'm thankful for that, don't mistakin' me black
'Cause you'll be stankin' in the back of a fuckin' Cadillac
I'ma get snuffed, 'cause I ain't said enough to pipe down
I pipe down, when the White House just wiped out
When I see that little Cheney dike get sniped out
Lights out, bitch adios, goodnight {*gunshot*} (AHH!)
Now put that in ya little pipe and bite down
Think for a minute 'cause the hype just died down
That I won't go up in the Oval Office right now
And flip whatever ain't tied down upside down
I'm all for America, fuck the government
Tell that seed to Laura, tell the slut to suck a dick
Motherfuck ducked, what the fuck? son of a bitch
Take away my gun, I'm gonna tuck some other shit
Can't tell me shit about the tricks of this trade
Switchblade, with a little switch to switch blades
And switch from a six to a sixteen inch blade
Shit's like a samurai sword of Cincy
Shit just don't change to this day
I'm this way, still tell that utslay ipsbay
Upsay my ipnay, 'scuse my ickpay, addelay
But uckfay the rap game

I ain't sellin' my soul for this rap game
I ain't diggin' no hole for this rap game
This rap game, this rap game
I wouldn't want to be drinkin', drowned in my own inequity
But fucked that I'ma rap 'til why'all all get sick of me
And clutch my nuts sack and spit all who pick at me
I'm pickin' a rott mix, fuck the dogs you sic on me
I'm sayin' you motherfuckers don't know us, quit playin'
If I'm broke, then I'm breakin' up in the place where you layin'
You know, same shit every nigga done in his life
I lived to this wise, speak on when I want when I write
So why should I ever fear another man
If he bleed like I bleed, take a piss and he stand?
OK, you win, you can say we can't rap
But no shorts 'cause I'm mean (???) say this is whack
I walk in that party and just start bussin' {*gunshots and screaming*}
Right after I hear the last verse of ""Self Destruction""
This liquor makes me want to blast the chrome
To let you know the time without Morris Dangerome (nigga)
I'm low down and shifty, quickly call Swifty
To do a drive-by on the tenth speed with 50
Ya feelin' lucky? Squeeze
I catch you outside of Chuckie Cheese
With ya seed, you be an unlucky G
My lifestyle is unstable, I party anatic
They said no fightin' in the club so I brought me a 'matic
Coughin' the static, I jump niggas, call me a rabbit
Poppin' the tablet and guns to soften (???)
[Chorus]
I snatch the chalk from the sidewalk and piss on the curb
This is absurd, we street niggas twistin' the words
We finally could ""Say Goodbye to Hollywood""
'cause Proof and Shyne man shit nothin' in common
But ask this band with gasoline chan
We never bow down to be a flash in the pan
No remorse, fuck ya stature dog
Nothin' to do with hands when I clap at why'all
But to draw on the ground with the form and the pound
Then I'm gone outta town 'fore the law come around
So we can battle with raps, we can battle with gats
Matter of fact, we can battle for plaques (This rap game)
I'm too fuckin' retarded
I don't give a fuck about my dick
That's why I'm datin' Lorraina Bobbet
My crew had an argument, who was the largest
Now they all is dead and I roll as a solo artist
Plus I made all the beats and wrote all the raps
Well I really didn't, but I did accordin' to this contract
I was thrown in the snow with nowhere to go
Freezin' 20 below, forced to join (???)
My little girl, she shouldn't listen to these lyrics
That's why I glued her headphones to her ear to make sure she hear it
If rap don't work, I'm startin' a group with Garth Brooks

I got so many minks, and so many leathers
The crib is surrounded by animal protesters
I'm a grown man, still livin' like I'm young
With the mind of an old man, full of wisdom
Here the cops come, task force van
Rock so much ice, I'm called Jack Frost man
And while we sippin' on cris', you sippin' backwash man
Your team got heart, but your heart's in my hand
You want sixteen bars, in song format
Or sixteen cars on your mom's doormat, what"

high-all-the-time,2003,50-cent,Hip-Hop,"Hey, you wanna hit this shit?
It's that green tongue, Cali bud
I don't need Dom Perignon, I don't need Cris
Tanqueray and Alize, I don't need shit
Nigga, I'm high all the time, I smoke that good shit
I stay high all the time, man, I'm on some hood shit
Give me some dro, purple haze and some chocolate
Give me a dutch and a lighter, I'll spark shit
And stay high all the time, I smoke that good shit
I'm high all the time, man, I'm on some hood shit
Every time I roll up niggas holla roll up
And I tell 'em hold up, you ain't getting money you ain't smoking
In my Benzo, 20 inch Lorenzo's
Smoking on indo, high as a motherfucker
I be on them backstreets, niggas know I clap heat
Only if you got beef, man ,you better holla at me
Niggas get locked up, stabbed up, shot up
Every time I pop up, a lot going on in my hood
I shoot the dice, I holla get 'em girls
Daddy need new shoes, daddy need Pirellis to look mean on 22's
Stash box, Xbox, laptop, fax machine, phone
Bulletproof this bitch and I'm gone
2003 Suburban swerving, too many sips of Henny
The D's sick, they searched the whip and they can't find the semi's
They was just harassing me cause they know who I was
Spent the night in Central Booking for smoking some bud
I don't need Dom Perignon, I don't need Cris
Tanqueray and Alize, I don't need shit
Nigga, I'm high all the time, I smoke that good shit
I stay high all the time, man, I'm on some hood shit

Now if you heard I done started some shit
It ain't because I be high, be high
And if you heard I done let off a clip
It ain't because I be high, be high
But I twist that lye, lye lye lye
I get high as I wanna, nigga
Go against me, for sure, you's a goner, nigga
I don't smoke to calm my nerves, but I got beef
Finna crush my enemies like I crush the hashish
If you love me tell me you love me, don't stare at me, man
I'd hate to be in the pen for clapping one of my fans
Let me show you how to greet me when you meet me, when you see me
If you real, my nigga, you know how to holla ""G-Unit""
There's no competition, it's just me
50 Cent, motherfucker, I'm hot on these streets
If David could go against Goliath with a stone
I can go at Nas and Jigga, both for the throne
I don't need Dom Perignon, I don't need Cris
Tanqueray and Alize, I don't need shit
Nigga, I'm high all the time, I smoke that good shit
I stay high all the time, man, I'm on some hood shit
Give me some dro, purple haze and some chocolate
Give me a dutch and a lighter, I'll spark shit
And stay high all the time, I smoke that good shit
I'm high all the time, man, I'm on some hood shit
Now who you know besides me who write lines and squeeze nines
And have hoes in the hood sniffing on white lines
You don't want me to be your kid's role model
I'll teach them how to buck them 380's and load up them hollows
Have shorty fresh off the stoop ready to shoot
Big blunt in his mouth, deuce-deuce in his boot
Sit in the crib sipping Guinness watching Menace
Then oh Lord, have a young nigga bucking shit like he O-Dog
My team they depend on me when it's crunch time
I eat a nigga food in broad day like it's lunchtime
You feeling brave, nigga, go ahead get gully
See if I won't leave your brains leaking up out your skully
I done made myself hot so ain't shit you can tell me
Now niggas calling me to feature, man, fuck your money
I ain't hurting, I'm aight, nigga, I'm doing good
I ain't gotta write rhymes, I got bricks in the hood
I don't need Dom Perignon, I don't need Cris
Tanqueray and Alize, I don't need shit
Nigga, I'm high all the time, I smoke that good shit
I stay high all the time, man, I'm on some hood shit
Give me some dro, purple haze and some chocolate
Give me a dutch and a lighter, I'll spark shit
And stay high all the time, I smoke that good shit

And your boss is a bitch, if he could he would
Sell his soul for cheap, trade his life to be Suge

You are now rapping, with 50 Cent
You gotta love it,
I just wanna chill and twist a lot
Catch suns in my 7-45
You drive me crazy shorty I
Need to see you and feel you next to me
I provide everything you need and I
Like your smile I don't wanna see you cry
Got some questions that I got to ask and I
Hope you can come up with the answers babe
Girl, It's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
Girl, It's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me girl?
If I fell off tomorrow would you still love me?
If I didn't smell so good would you still hug me?
If I got locked up and sentenced to a quarter century,
Could I count on you to be there to support me mentally?
If I went back to a hoopty from a Benz, would you poof and disappear like
Some of my friends?
If I was hit and I was hurt would you be by my side?
If it was time to put in work would you be down to ride?
I'd get out and peel a nigga cap and chill and drive
I'm asking questions to find out how you feel inside
If I ain't rap 'cause I flipped burgers at Burger King
Would you be ashamed to tell your friends you feelin' me?
In the bed if I used my tongue would you like that?
If I wrote you a love letter would you write back?
Now we can have a lil' drink you know a nightcap
And we could go do what you like, I know you like that
Girl, It's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
Girl, It's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me girl?
Now would you leave me if you're father found out I was thuggin'?
Do you believe me when I tell you, you the one I'm loving?
Are you mad 'cause I'm asking you 21 questions?
Are you my soul mate? 'Cause if so, girl you a blessing
Do you trust me enough, to tell me your dreams?
I'm staring at ya' trying to figure how you got in them jeans
If I was down would you say things to make me smile?
I treat you how you want to be treated just teach me how

And when you asked me about it I said it wasn't me
Would you believe me? Or up and leave me?
How deep is our bond if that's all it takes for you to be gone?
We only humans girl we make mistakes, to make it up I do whatever it take
I love you like a fat kid love cake
You know my style I say anything to make you smile
Girl, It's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
Girl, It's easy to love me now

I apply pressure to pussies that stunting I pop
Stand alone squeezing my pistol I'm sure that I gotta
Now Peter Piper picked peppers and don't rock rhymes
I'm 50 Cent, I write a lil bit but I pop nines
Tell niggas, ""Get they money right,"" 'cause I got mine
And I'm around quit playing nigga you can't shine
You goin' be that next chump to end up in the trunk
After being hit by the pump, is that what you want?
Be easy nigga, I'll lay your ass out

When streetlights come on niggas blast the nines
Get locked up, they read books to pass the time
In the game there's up's and down's, so I stay on the grind
Niggas on my dick more than my bitch, I stay on they mind
They ain't nothing they could do to stop my shine
This is God's plan homey, this ain't mine
I played the music loud so Grandpa called me a nuisance
And Grandma, who always gotta throw in her two cent
I'm the drop out who made more more money than these teachers
Roofless like the Coupe but I come with more features
I am what I am, you could like it or love it

Niggaz wanna shine like me (me), rhyme like me (me)
Then walk around with a 9 like me (me)
They don't wanna do it, 3 to 9 like me
And they ain't strong enough to take 9 like me
Aiyoo, you think about shittin' on 50... save it
My songs belong in the Bible with King David
I teach niggaz sign language, that ain't def son
*click* *click* you heard that? That mean RUN
Ask around, I ain't the one you wanna stun on, pa
Pull through, I'll throw a fuckin cocktail at ya' car
From the last shootout, I got a demple on my face
It's nothin', I could go after Mase's fanbase
Shell hit my jaw, I ain't wait for doctor to get it out
Hit my wisdom tooth *huck-too* spit it out
I don't smile a lot, cause ain't nothin' pretty
Got a purple heart for war, and I ain't never left the City

On the dick like they heard I ghostwrite for P.Diddy
You got fat while we starve, it's my turn

I got a head full of evil thoughts, am I Satan

In the telly with to whores, a Benz with to doors
32 carrots in the traws, no flaws
You see me in the hood, I got atleast two guns
I carry the glock, Tony carry my M-1s
Hold me down nigga, OGs tryin' to rock me

See a bitch gettin in my whip, she probably gon' blow me

I owe you for this one
I've been patiently waiting for a track to explode on
You can stun if you want and your ass will get rolled on
It feels like my flows been hot for so long
If you thinking I'm fucking fall off your so wrong
Innocent in my head, like a baby born dead
Destination heaven, sit and politic with passengers from nine eleven
The lords blessings leave me lyrically inclined
Shit I ain't even gotta try to shine
God's the seamstress that tailor fitted my pain
I got scriptures in my brain I could spit at your dame
Straight out the good book, look, niggas is shook
50 fears no man, warrior swing swords like Conan
Picture me pen in hand write lines knowing the source'll quote it
When I die, they'll read this and say a genius wrote it
I grew up without my pops should that make me bitter?
I caught cases I copped out does that make me a quitter?
In this white man's world I'm similar to a squirrel
Lookin for a slut with a nice butt to get a nut
If I get shot today my phone will stop ringing again
These industry niggaz ain't friends, they know how to pretend
Patiently waiting to make it through all the hating
Debating whether or not you could even weather the storm.
Just lay on the table they operating to save you
Its like an angel came to you sent from the heavens above
They think they're crazy but they ain't crazy lets face it, shit basically
They just playing sick, they ain't shit They ain't saying shit, spray 'em Fifty
A to the K, get in the way I'll bring Dre and them wit me
And turn this day into fucking mayhem you staying with me?
Don't let me lose you, I'm not trying to confuse you
When I let loose with this Uzi and just shoot through your Isuzu
You get the message am I getting through to you?
You know whats coming you motherfuckers don't even know do you?
Take some Big and some Pac and you mix them up in a pot
Sprinkle a little Big L on top, and what the fuck do you got?
You got the realest and illest killers tied up in a knot
The Juggernauts of this rap shit like it or not
Its like a fight to the top just to see who died for the spot
You put your life in this, nothing like surviving the shot
Y'all know what time it is as soon as Fifty signs on this dot
Shit what you know about death threats, 'cause I get a lot
Shady Records was eighty seconds away from the towers
Some cowards fucked with the wrong building they meant to hit ours
Better evacuate all children - nuclear shower
There's nothing spookier, you're now about to witness the power of fuckin Fifty
I've been patiently waiting for a track to explode on
You can stun if you want and your ass will get rolled on
It feels like my flows been hot for so long
If you thinking I'm fucking fall off your so wrong
I've been patiently waiting for a track to explode on
You can stun if you want and your ass will get rolled on
It feels like my flows been hot for so long
If you thinking I'm fucking fall off your so wrong
The guns spark when the shots go off
Its fifty, they say its Fifty
See a nigga laid out with his fucking top blown off
Its fifty, man that wasn't Fifty, they don't holla my name
You shouldn't throw stones if you live in a glass house
And if you got a glass jaw, you should watch your mouth
Cause I'll break your face, have your ass running
Mumbling to the Jake, you going against me dog you making a mistake
Ill split you have you looking like the Michael Jackson's jackets with all them zippers
I'm the boss on this boat, you can call me skipper
The way I turn the money over you should call me flipper
Your bitch, a regular bitch, you calling her wifey
I fucked her, I feed her fast food, you keeping her icy
I'm down to sell records but not my soul
Snoop said this in 94' ""We don't love them hoes""
I got pennies for my thoughts, now I'm rich
See the twenty's spinning looking mean on the six
Niggas wearing flags, 'cause the colors match they clothes
They get caught in the wrong hood and get filled up with holes (motherfucker).
I've been patiently waiting for a track to explode on

Swimmin' in barrels of money
Ma could walk around wit' a head up
And challenge you dummy
It's funny, niggaz rather see you sufferin' and hungry
I'm hungry as hell, skatin' with another nigga's money
You lyin' your ass off, you know you ain't that tough
I'm pullin' your mask off as soon as you act up
You know what I came for, it isn't the game ball
artillery that's about as long as a chainsaw

I'm wide awake, but it still feels like I'm dreamin'
Forty Cal under my pillow, condom feelin' my semen
The physical presence of a female, form of a demon
That's why, I fuck 'em and leave 'em
Get my nut while I'm breathin'
'Cause they thought they'd catch me slippin'
Now I'm duckin' and trippin'
That's a thousand dollar outfit what the fuck is you rippin'?
You trippin', more records could get my ass in position
Death wish for no religion whether Catholic or Christian
Listen, I went through, mama bitchin' in and out the kitchen
With probable cause, papa was in and out of prison
You got soldiers, but you still gotta respect ours
We got more four five's and nines than a deck of cards
You can take me out the 'hood, but can't take the 'hood out me

'Cause I'm ghetto, I'm ghetto

I'll smuggle, I'm nothin' but trouble
I'll make your money double
Cook me in baking soda
I'll turn your Hooprock into a new Range Rover
I'll pay all your bills and fill your 'frigerator
Feed your family, turn your man to a hater
Put me in your doorpanels or your stashbox
Put me in your Nik's, Timbs or Reeboks
If you cop three and a half you hustlin' backwards
Cop a hundred grams
You movin' forwards
You tryin' to move more birds
In PA all day, on the corner of Third
You can take me out the 'hood
But can't take the 'hood out me

The shells hit you, you screamin'

Start wavin' my emboies shell cases get the droppin'

Like if it's down the corner, I got too much pride to hide
I'm outside, gun in my pocket just stunnin', I'm stoppin'
I'm dyin' to pop it, I'm young and I'm restless
You know my contestants
As the world turns, there's lessons to be learned
Count all my blessin's, clean up my weapons
I'm ready for war, the strong survive, the weak will parish
I told you before, hoes they compliment me now like ""50 nice chain""

Burn out, can't stop gotta watch MTV, BET

I wonder if you mad, 'cause I'm doin' good
Or 'cause niggaz feelin' me more than you in your own 'hood

To young to understand the consequences of a man
Living a lie, I gotta get that money
I'll be damned if I'm bummy
Gotta watch my back around these niggas cause they funny
20 years of watching my mama's tears got my heated, heavily weeded
Smoking that bong cause I need it
These niggas don't want me balling, they want me buried
Bogged in the dirt from shots flurried
Laying with bugs under my shirt
I got plans to hop up in that Hummer
Cause I'm a stunner, I sit back and wonder
When them angels gonna call my number under
My chest is a heart of a lion
I ain't lying, bounty hunters got me flying
With my iron, high as a giant
I'm running from nothing, my stomach is touching what I'm clutching
To give you more than a concussion, end of discussion
My blood is colder so I'm bolder
Hennessy and soda, hood on my shoulder
Look in the mirror, I see a soldier
Right now I'm on the edge so don't push me
I aim straight for your head so don't push me
Fill your ass up with lead,so don't push me
I got something for your ass, keep thinking I'm pussy
Right now I'm on the edge so don't push me
I aim straight for your head so don't push me
Fill your ass up with lead,so don't push me
I got something for your ass, keep thinking I'm pussy
These are my ideas, this is my sweat and tears
This is shit that I saw with my eyeballs, my ears
This is me, who's gotta be what you see on TV
What you hear on CD, what appears easy
Man these teenie boppers see me on these magazine covers
In these beanies and these rags living fantasies
Fronting like it's all fun and games 'til the shoot 'em up bang
And you see your brains hang and you see we ain't playing
Ain't saying we ain't laying down at night and ain't praying
I bullied my way in this game, man, I'm done playing
Man, I'm done saying that I'm done playing
I'mma start laying into these motherfucking cocksuckers
There's no way I'm back down like a god damn coward
I can't, how would I look as a man bowing to his knees?
Like the mad cow disease, let somebody lash out at me
And not lash back out at 'em, please
Oh, whoa, yo, ho, hold up, oh no, not me, not Marshall
You wanna see Marshall? I'll show you Marshall
I try to show you art, but you just pick it apart
So I see I have to start, showing you fucking old farts
A whole other side I wanted to not show you
So you know you're not dealing with some fucking marshmallow
Little soft yellow, punk pussy, whose heart's Jello cause
Right now I'm on the edge so don't push me
I aim straight for your head so don't push me
Fill your ass up with lead,so don't push me
I got something for your ass, keep thinking I'm pussy
Right now I'm on the edge so don't push me
I aim straight for your head so don't push me
Fill your ass up with lead,so don't push me

And you can run for ya backup
But them machine gun shells gone tear ya back up

If I die today I'm happy how my life turned out
See the shootouts that I've been in I'm by myself
Locked up I was in a box by myself
I done made myself a millionaire by myself
Now shit changed, motherfucker, I can hire some help
I done heard about the 50 grand you put in the hood
But ya shooter fin'nin to get shot, it won't do him no good
With a pistol I define the definition of pain
If you survive ya bones'll still fucking hurt when it rain
Oh, you a pro at playing battleship? Well, this ain't the same
Little homie this is a whole different type of war game
See the losers end up in shackles and motherfucking chains

They like me, I want them to love me like they love 'Pac
But holla in New York them niggas'll tell ya I'm loco
And the plan is to put the rap game in a choke hold

Niggas, I'm still grinding (yeah), I still hearing those sirens
I'm still getting chased by those lights
Only the light's lime, and my mic's on
And my time is none, because I'm writing more
I don't hear to meet a soul in this business
I'm here to eat, speak, until these ho's feel this
I ain't gonna let you derail me, man
I got Young Kobe homey, you gotta let go of Obie
Cause Obie be back, (going nowhere, man) we got them craps going on
And that yak going on, soon as a nigga touch down, back from town
It's forever, put that on the cheddar, man
But in the meantime, it's Jimmy Iovine time
Chase cheese, rhyme 'til my voice give out
This is it my niggas, this what we boast about
Now I'm here, so shut your motherfucking mouth, and show me love, bitch
[Chorus]
I just want to love, for the rest of my life (I don't love you, bitch)
I want to hold you in the morn, hold you thorough the night

we don't love no bitches, though)
I just want to love, for the rest of my life
I want to hold you in the morn, hold you in the night

There's a certain mystique when I speak, that you notice
Cause it's sort of unique 'cause you know it's me
My poetry's deep, and I'm still-matic, the way I flow to this beat
You can't sit still, it's like trying to smoke crack and go to sleep
I'm strapped, it's known any minute I could snap
I'm the equivalent of what would happen if Bush rapped
I bully these rappers so bad lyrically
It ain't even funny, I ain't even hungry, it ain't even money
You can't pay me enough for you to play me
It's cockamamie you just ain't zany enough to rock with Shady
My noodle is cock-a-doodle, my clock's coo-coo
I got screws loose, yea the whole kit and caboodle, I'm just brutal
It's no rumor, I'm numero uno, assume it, there's no more humor in it, you know
I'm rolling with a swollen bowling ball in my bag
You need a fag and tear a new hole in my ass, you better love me, bitch

My buzz is crazy in the hood, they holla my name
If it ain't about the flow, it's 'bout the stones and the chain

Nine eleven Porsche same color as cranberry sauce
I ain't gon' front, I thought R. Kelly was the shit
Let me find out he fucking 'round with Bow Wow bitch
Niggas eating popcorn, right, rewinding the tape
Now shorty mama in the precinct hollering rape
I'm convinced, man, something really wrong with these ho's
I thought Lil' Kim was hot, 'til she start fucking with her nose
I used to listen to Lauryn Hill, and tap my feet
Then the bitch put out a CD and didn't have no beats
That nigga D'Angelo, he determined not to fail
That nigga went butt-ass, for his record to sell
My back shot to help Ashanti hit them high notes
And Big Ben taught Charlie B 'More to deep throat (yea)

Better watch how you talk, when you talk about me

Don't look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me
Now these pussy niggas putting money on my head
Go on and get your refund motherfucker, I ain't dead
I'm the diamond in the dirt, that ain't been found
I'm the underground king and I ain't been crowned
When I rhyme, something special happen every time
I'm the greatest, something like Ali in his prime
I walk the block with the bundles
I've been knocked on the humble
Swing the ox when I rumble
Show your ass what my gun do
Got a temper nigga, go 'head, lose your head
Turn your back on me, get clapped and lose your legs

Joy wouldn't feel so good, if it wasn't for pain
Death gotta be easy, 'cause life is hard
It'll leave you physically, mentally, and emotionally scarred
This if for my niggas on the block, twisting trees and cigars
For the niggas on lock, doing life behind bars
I don't see only god can judge me, 'cause I see things clear
Quick these crackers will give my black ass a hundred years
I'm like Paulie in Goodfellas, you can call me the Don
Like Malcolm by any means, with my gun in my palm
Slim switched sides on me, let niggas ride on me
I thought we was cool, why you want me to die homie?
Many men, many, many, many, many men
Wish death 'pon me
Lord I don't cry no more
Don't look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me
Have mercy on my soul
Somewhere my heart turned cold
Have mercy on many men
Many, many, many, many men
Wish death upon me
Every night I talk to god, but he don't say nothing back
I know he protecting me, but I still stay with my gat
In my nightmares, niggas keep pulling techs on me
Psych says some bitch dumb, put a hex on me
The feds didn't know much, when Pac got shot
I got a kite from the pens that told me, Tuck got knocked
I ain't gonna spell it out for you motherfuckers all the time
Are you illiterate nigga? You can't read between the lines
In the bible it says, what goes around, comes around
Almost shot me, three weeks later he got shot down
Now it's clear that I'm here, for a real reason
'Cause he got hit like I got hit, but he ain't fucking breathing
Many men, many, many, many, many men
Wish death 'pon me

Don't look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me
Have mercy on my soul
Somewhere my heart turned cold
Have mercy on many men

I owe you for this one

You can stun if you want and your ass will get rolled on
It feels like my flows been hot for so long
If you thinking I'm fucking fall off your so wrong
Innocent in my head, like a baby born dead
Destination heaven, sit and politic with passengers from nine eleven
The lords blessings leave me lyrically inclined
Shit I ain't even gotta try to shine
God's the seamstress that tailor fitted my pain
I got scriptures in my brain I could spit at your dame
Straight out the good book, look, niggas is shook
50 fears no man, warrior swing swords like Conan
Picture me pen in hand write lines knowing the source'll quote it
When I die, they'll read this and say a genius wrote it
I grew up without my pops should that make me bitter?
I caught cases I copped out does that make me a quitter?
In this white man's world I'm similar to a squirrel
Lookin for a slut with a nice butt to get a nut
If I get shot today my phone will stop ringing again
These industry niggaz ain't friends, they know how to pretend
Patiently waiting to make it through all the hating
Debating whether or not you could even weather the storm.
Just lay on the table they operating to save you
Its like an angel came to you sent from the heavens above
They think they're crazy but they ain't crazy lets face it, shit basically
They just playing sick, they ain't shit They ain't saying shit, spray 'em Fifty
A to the K, get in the way I'll bring Dre and them wit me
And turn this day into fucking mayhem you staying with me?
Don't let me lose you, I'm not trying to confuse you
When I let loose with this Uzi and just shoot through your Isuzu
You get the message am I getting through to you?
You know whats coming you motherfuckers don't even know do you?
Take some Big and some Pac and you mix them up in a pot
Sprinkle a little Big L on top, and what the fuck do you got?
You got the realest and illest killers tied up in a knot
The Juggernauts of this rap shit like it or not
Its like a fight to the top just to see who died for the spot
You put your life in this, nothing like surviving the shot
Y'all know what time it is as soon as Fifty signs on this dot
Shit what you know about death threats, 'cause I get a lot
Shady Records was eighty seconds away from the towers
Some cowards fucked with the wrong building they meant to hit ours
Better evacuate all children - nuclear shower
There's nothing spookier, you're now about to witness the power of fuckin Fifty

I've been patiently waiting for a track to explode on
You can stun if you want and your ass will get rolled on
It feels like my flows been hot for so long
If you thinking I'm fucking fall off your so wrong
The guns spark when the shots go off
Its fifty, they say its Fifty
See a nigga laid out with his fucking top blown off
Its fifty, man that wasn't Fifty, they don't holla my name
You shouldn't throw stones if you live in a glass house
And if you got a glass jaw, you should watch your mouth
Cause I'll break your face, have your ass running
Mumbling to the Jake, you going against me dog you making a mistake
Ill split you have you looking like the Michael Jackson's jackets with all them zippers
I'm the boss on this boat, you can call me skipper
The way I turn the money over you should call me flipper
Your bitch, a regular bitch, you calling her wifey
I fucked her, I feed her fast food, you keeping her icy
I'm down to sell records but not my soul
Snoop said this in 94' ""We don't love them hoes""
I got pennies for my thoughts, now I'm rich
See the twenty's spinning looking mean on the six
Niggas wearing flags, 'cause the colors match they clothes
They get caught in the wrong hood and get filled up with holes (motherfucker).

Show par with the fishes

In that amazin' sun
I'm amazin' son
You niggas wonder
Where my grace is from
I speak with corrupted tongue
Recognized the underworld
Since I was young
Back in '84 when I saw
Crocket and Tubbs as the law
These eyes got big
When they televised that raw
My Mama should've seen it comin'
Me runnin' up and down
The stairs too quick
Hummin' Miami Vice theme music
Call the 'roin made me colder
I see the villains' impact
Now that I'm older
Ignorant fool
Views ignorant, too
Got a lot of money
Keep militant tools
Wasn't present the session
They handed out the rules
So I grab a tape
It related to life's trues
The meanin'?
Pusha T's more than you're seemin'
Not just a rap name
More so like a damn shame
Nothin's changed
Just the crimes is less heinous
The three of us know
Yet the shooter remains nameless
And I don't even watch my back
I was raw before rap
And I ain't lost my past
Shit could get hairy
I could lose myself in a flash
Niggas will think I'm Jim Carrey
How I off that Mask
I even went by the book at first
Until I realized nine to five
Wouldn't quench my thirst, so I
Start my mission
Leave my residence
Mama knew that a child like me
Had better sense
But somethin' had to give
That's real, I had to live
I chefed that soft white
And pumped from her crib
Scouts honor started with my grandmama
Who distributed Yay
She had flown in from the Bahamas
Partner, please, I grinds
I hustle with ease
Can damn near eyeball
Any weight in my sleep
I don't entertain hate
Surroundin' the street
If I was you
I'd be tryin' to get down with me
But no, see these niggas know too much
Meanwhile I rock jewels
That look like my diamonds blush
Cats act as if rap fell in my lap
I've suffered heartbreak
Many times back to back
And still feel belittled
Sittin' here spittin' riddles
Amongst clown ass rappers
Who tend to give me the giggles
Let 'em take it
However they wanna take it
I'm the reason your favorite MC's
No longer your favorite
Hey, I'm one of the greats
I can't lie
I mean great to the point
I'm concerned I might die
Make no mistake

It's all in the name
Trust, I will wound you"

It's a whole different degree of homicide, nigga...

I'm from Virginia, where ain't shit to do but cook (Talk about, what?)
Pack it up, sell it triple-price, fuck the books (Talk about, what?)

So when we pull up, it ain't shit to do but look (Talk about, what?)

In my ""Home Sweet Home"" I keep chrome next to my bones
Alters my walk to limpin'
Since I love the feel, I guess I'm passionately pimpin'
It 'tis what it seems
That thing imprintin' through the seams of my jeans, by all means
Lost it all, from lives to love
Put my faith in my money, help me rise above
See I turned to the Lord when them times got tough
Bullied through streets, powder I pushed and shoved
In that ole' Virginey
Out of ten niggas, nine are guinea
No money, all they know is gimme, got semis waitin'
Heat like Caribbean summers, I been there
Each year, a diffferent bitch wonder
Who wing she gon' fall under, Push' or Mal'
Ganga grinds, wit' me, with thoughts of fuckin' them cross her mind
Look ma, that's right up my alley
I love my family, I want them all happy
In Virginia, we smirked at that Simpson trial
Yeah, I guess the chase was wild
But what's the fuss about?
See, plenty my partners feelin' like O.J.
Beat murder like the shit is OK, that's what our door say
Talk the evil that men do, I'm lost in the mental

In regards to my paper, now they guessin' my weight
They fast to predict the outcome of my fate
Wonderin' 'bout Clipse and if they got what it take
Malice, he think he hard, tough guy of the clique
And Pusha, he walk around like he swear he the shit
You right on both counts, bitch, Clipse is us
And there are some things that you don't discuss
Don't ask me 'bout the Neptunes and what's they fair
Don't ask about the loud screamin' chick with the hair
Don't ask about my music, and how that's comin' 'bout
Don't ask about my album, or when's it comin' out
'Cause I feel like you really being funny on the slide
Now face down, layin' on your tummy, or you die
I tried being humble, humble get no respect
Now the first sign of trouble, that's a hole up in your neck
Plus, what I look like spendin' my nights in jail
I could never be a thug, they don't dress this well
I reside in VA, ride in VA
Most likely when I die, I'm gon' die in VA
Virginia's for lovers, but trust there's hate here
For out-of-towners, who think that they gon' move weight here
Ironic, the same same place I'm makin' figures at
That there's the same land they used to hang niggas at, in Virginia...

This shit is like 2-11 mixed wit coke
Leave you spinning like the tennis balls in ya spoke, nigga
Dark secrets, man I won't lie
They came to the light a man is gon' die
All hope is lost and Famlay's gon' fry
Cause I did shit the average man just won't try
Like what, war against an army wit a hand gun
I'm Famlay, and when my f**king chance come
I'm running wit it, on e'ry song I'm coming wit
See some you think you can take from me, then come and get it
See I'm from Huntersville, e'ry thang we done is real
My niggas come in here, my niggas come to kill
And I dare y'all to try and diss us
See you in the streets it ain't nothing discuss
Maaan, we gon' stomp yo ass dead in the ground
New weeks, couple bodies where yo head'll be found, nigga
Cut off ya wrists, and they feet no prints (Gangsta)
Now I'm in the Six, (Gangsta) wit the heat no tense, you see me

You don't wanna tango, I'll dress you in a halo
Cock the gauge, polka dot ya braids
Face you in a chrome fo', that'll lock ya legs
And you can't move, I roll big and I can't lose
They watch so hard ain't nothin' I do, that ain't news
Carry it like I'm a stranger to the game
I cut short any whisper that, en-danger my name
I'm a toast on both coast, not for a joke
I'm known in the streets on the account, I know coke
And we got word in the street that the cops watch us
But that don't stop us, we maneuvering move a little mo' cautious
I hate to think that the dope game is my callin'
Cause it got us singing lullaby's, to our fallin'
Tonight friend, until we meet again
But for now and ya name, we re-up and eat again, uh
I never front, like I'm something I'm not
Well being broke well that's just, somethin' I'm not
Y'all talk wit hatred, but I live off that
And I lived off cocaine, way 'fore I lived off rap
Feel me friend, if they could, they'd kill me friend (Yeah)
Cause I weigh too much, learned not to say too much
They couldn't take me in the C-L, that's way too much
And I'm too gone, y'all niggas can talk on
They call me Mr., Please believe it, believe it please
I put the pump in ya mouth, and help you breath with ease
This guys in a hurry, ma I can't even fuck with you
If you ain't in the itinerary
I don't know where dudes is buying they jewelry
Why's ya ice cream, like it's made by Ben & Jerry
Y'all the type of players, that be gettin' 2-day contracts
E-mail snitch, got these in ya 2-way contacts
I'm in the club sippin' on that new Zecongac
In the number 9 Jordan's, with the deuce, trey, arm back
The street family so cool, we could throw up bitches
Even if it was July, and we had on wood britches
I got them teflon's, that shovel the fo'
That have under covers and po', with cover and slow
The government know, the kid been lovin' the dough
Since I was movin' white off the curb, and shovelin' snow
Ghetto streets so numb they call me Novocain
I turn over caine, over and over again
Hell, so much clientele, I could lose it all today
Be back the next day, still up in the same way
As I left ya, all in three gestures, down up and aim
I can define death, better than Webster, wet ya
Now bless ya, and of to my next venture
Blocks so white, June look like December
Winter time, snow everywhere, flow everywhere
So much dough, I fly my hoes everywhere
Ask him, Pusha T, push a ton
Push a ton of that shit, that makes ya nose run
Yes I'm holdin', whether it's heat or coke in
In the door panel of my four-wheel motion
Ain't jokin', but I laugh how other flows convince you
It's money, it's funny, it's Comedy Central
Minds mental, others is made up stinsel
When I'm on vacation, my babies ride in a rental
I'm livin', they act as if I don't live it
Saran wrap Vaseline, so they can't sniff it
Eve say Larine knitted, shorts Bermuda
You would think they was poochie, if you over looked Medusa"

Shorty in my ear say she got a thong on
And I love how she move any time a song on

Come this way and prove somethin' to me

Pin her ass to the sofa and attack the chocha

But I thought about how rich I am and said, ""No sir!""
Chick was crazy, gave her crazy space
What is it the ""Whip Appeal"", or my Babyface?

The night's still young and I'm already leanin'
Cruise through the lot on the deuce-2's gleamin'

Obnoxious with the women, hot tucked in the linen

Please let me love you girl
Just wanna love you girl
c'mon, I wanna love you girl
Just wanna love you girl
Let me love you girl
Let me
When we met I was talkin' that game
Parkin' that thang
Since then between us
A lot of things changed
Now it's like the world got a whole different name
I can't stop chics from sayin' my name
Most of it's lies
If not, don't be surprised
You knew I was ballin' when I met you
But really, I started layin' low just to net you
I'm raw as hell, yet can't deny that you special
These girls can't either
Winter, his and her Vivas
Summer, his and her Louie sneakers
You don't think that bother people
Guess again you even need to check your friends
Sayin' that I cheat, right, maybe with my heat
Got a pearl handled chrome thing that I call Sweets
I greet wit' her, creep wit' her, even eat wit' her
Late nights under my sheets, yeah, I sleep with her but that's it
Ma, I don't love her
Don't listen to her words
She tryin' to split us as lovebirds
But that's not it
Now you see me buyin' her whips and shit
You see me sendin' her on trips and shit
If the answers no don't forget
I don't know
If I don't know I don't know, let's not go that road
I don't know who she is, don't care who told
Look stop flippin', no need to explode
I seen the number in the pager, I don't know that code
In the streets too much, c'mon, that's absurd
Gettin' no complaints when I be flippin' them birds
Your girls just talk 'bout this that and the third
Believe half what you see none of what you heard
You askin' me who's her, I'm askin' who's mink fur
With that rock on her hand makin' their eyes blurred
Could that be you plus who cop every gem
Who spend like I spend, then act like it then
Got the dream home and we settled in it
Our lives too perfect that's why they meddle in it
Now, just chalk it up as just part of the game
You know who I'm about, who got part of my name?
Ma, I don't love her
Don't listen to her words
She tryin' to split us as lovebirds
But that's not it
Now you see me buyin' her whips and shit
You see me sendin' her on trips and shit
If the answers no don't forget
I don't know
Do you love me babe?
You thinkin' of me babe
I bet you'd tell me anything
Just to be with me
Do you love me babe?
You thinkin' of me babe
I bet you'd tell me anything
Just to be with me
I'm not most men my heart truer than theirs
Of course your girls hate, our whips newer than theirs
We hardly fight, arguments way fewer than theirs
Even down to the ice, look, bluer than theirs
What they gonna tell us about us, huh?
What they talk 'bout without us, huh?
The envy got 'em speakin' loosely
Tell 'em walk in your shoes but first let 'em know they Gucci
And even if I did twist her
I promise I didn't kiss her
Won't shit touchy feely
Grudge on the floor like mister did the silly
No respect shown
My homies laugh while she talk dirty on the speaker phone
Now don't you start
I spared your heart
If you ain't see it I didn't do it
Ain't I played my part?
Bricks chics whips chips, that just go with the grind
What else do you want from me, to say it, fine
Ma, I don't love her
Don't listen to her words
She tryin' to split us as lovebirds
But that's not it
Now you see me buyin' her whips and shit
You see me sendin' her on trips and shit
If the answers no don't forget
I don't know

Spittin' and skittin' and shit, naw, not me
I'm not you, I'm not you rapper, I'm not you, Pusha
I keep that ziploc bustin' at the stitches, culinary chemist
I serve the malicious to break the fiends fixes
One give you the sniffles, the other leave you with the itches
Transport, airport with the vaseline
So I can fulfill my dreams of passion as green
More cash then ya seen within Ashton it's green
Me drivin' up fast with the lean, zonin' family
Keep youngin's in them rented Camry's
Door panels full of shit and I ain't full of shit
Reckless ass, God forbid they don't crash
From the panel to the dash, it's four pounds of slab
Naw, bitch we don't believe in air bags
Cars turn tricks like them Ringling brother skits
Whether bitch hop out or the glock pop out
Ya know, what I'm about
Blow to ya sinus 'til the snot drop out
Whoever said birds fly south for the winters, a damn lie
Got 'em right here and if I don't like you the grams high
Take it or leave it, soon as a fiend, taste it, they need it
They could smoke it right in front of you to make you believe it
Prolly think, I won't murder you the way I smile
But I'ma take a lota shots, A I style
Jada, the name is filthy but so what
The motherfuckin' game is filthy
You know, what? My mom and my pops really did a good job
But it was the Montega and the Cane the built me
So I could never hate on another brother
God is great, the devil is a motherfucker
When you broke but they think you got money
Crackers start showin' you love, ya own people act funny
I tear niggas heads off, I don't discriminate
Waves, cornrows or dreads, I will eliminate
I'm far from a noodle, nigga, I stab up block reps
And turn quiet streets into hot sex
Nigga, that's funny you say you a killa, how?
What is it the return of the killer clown?
You don't put no fear in my heart
I make ya people say, 'wow', that didn't look like my man
They flipped upside down, the coroner did what he can
He got hit wit ten rounds at pointblank and pointblank
Coldchian left that nigga stankin'
Half static and face I got the wrinkling, slugs all in it
I had my eyes on his mink and I didn't give 'em
A chance to blink when I dodged up on 'em
Pressed the forty up on him shocked 'em
Made his head stand on end and like a baby I rocked 'em
The Coffin, the cradle, you can't bite the hand that made you
That's the beginning of the end and you a thug that pretends
Carl Coldchain, suit the nigga, I got a great vision I see through men
And squeeze triggers wit' bullets that go through men
Fuck wit S P, that's ya date with death
Got bullets that'll grape ya chest, no sleep like I hate the rest
I'm in the hood like it's my fate to rep
I hold it down any place I step and I love gettin' slept on
'Cause I'm rawer than dope fresh outta Africa that never been stepped on
Dog, I'ma clap at you the minute that you rep wrong
Holiday, the ghost the main reason why ya set gone
Why I love riffin', the war you wouldn't understand
'Cause my God is different than yours
If the world spin in a circle, I want 'em to learn move backwards
Kill niggas the first minute they jerk you
What you keep the toaster for creepin' through the hood
And shit ain't really good but I'm deeper than the ocean floor
Higher than a plane and meaner than a baller
Want ya insides out so I mean it when I pull
Rappers is talking to me as if, come on
We in the same boat, I tell them quick, no, I move Coke
And you and I don't share no common bond
So forgive me if I don't receive you with open arms, no
It shames me to no end to feed poison
To those who could very well be my kin
But where there's demand, someone will supply
So I feed them their needs at the same time cry
Yes, it pains me to see them need this
All of them lost souls and I'm their Jesus
Deepest regret and sympathy to the street
I see them pay for they fix when they kids couldn't eat, so sorry
And with this in mind, I still didn't quit
And that's how I know that I ain't shit, I ain't shit

Motherfucker hit you then you better hit him back
So when I hit the nigga it go blame
And nigga outta line
Back when I was 'bout big wheels and race tracks
Pop push the tornado and rode to eight tracks
Never stood a chance, exposed from way back
Lying to the baby, saying it's Ajax
I was about four, when I walked passed that door
That should have been closed where I first witnessed the raw
See in my household it was quite unique
Playing' hide and seek you might find a key
Car blames accidents so late branded my mental
Hal's my role model in that Lincoln Continental
Bought all my friends icees, it was about six
And when he pull off I was like ""See told you we was rich""
How I turned out let it be no surprise
When they speak of cousin Ricky it brings tears to their eyes, see
My family got a history of hustlers
Lil' brother, big brother, mother to grandmother, it's tradition

When I was a young boy
My mama always told me don't take no shit
Motherfucker hit you then you better hit him back
So when I hit the nigga it go blame
And nigga outta line, I said, ""Motherfucker's outta line""
My momma didn't see it coming, my daddy was there
What's my excuse? Cartoons were the root
Started with Yosemite Sam
With the gun in palm of each hand
What couldn't I demand see
Thirteen, studied the gansta's lean
Lil' grim no smile, lotta cash meanwhile
Daddy had the Chrystler fifth avey
Hustlers on the block cars were aerodynamic
With ghetto paint jobs, mango M 3's
On seventeen inch BB's, riding tough
The bike was huffy, attention was froze
And a twenty-five cent frozen cup laid my soul
The streets had made the mold
Since fourteen holding' push a T was chosen
Rebel like Che Gueverra, RC Tyco verses Carrera, pick
I'm a tell you what I'm talking bout
When I was a young boy
My mama always told me don't take no shit
Mother fucker hit you then you better hit him back
So when I hit the nigga it go blame blame

I think of grandma and the weight she would foot 'em
She kinda remind me of Madame Queen in hoodlum
Spoiled the grandkids, each one she would treasure
Said she kept two guns and to do so was a pleasure
The cigarette dangled, forty-five degree angle
Still every bit a lady but you don't wanna tangle
Let that explain me and how I got involved
Young N's hustlers in the creek, me, Jon Jon and Jamal
Age fifteen, walking through the hallway
Played the New Jordan's, first one's on the scene
See I could afford them, living out a dream
Hustler on the rise, laces untied
Slid pass Young N's, couldn't break my stride
Didn't know I was knotted in street ties
Teachers asking how and why, bitches passing by
Oh my he so gangsta!
I'ma tell you what I'm talking about
When I was a young boy
My mama always told me don't take no shit
Motherfucker hit you then you better hit him back
So when I hit the nigga it go blame
And nigga outta line, I said, ""Your nigga's outta line""
I'ma tell you what I'm talking about
Outta line!"

But if it don't, that's yo ass my man

I got guns 'cause they got guns
I get cash they get none
So I'm sure you see where that leaves me
In the streets with two heats, both one within my reach
I speak slow, let 'em understand my speech
When I say, ""Get low, these hold ten shots each
Please, don't move too fast, I scared of why'all niggas and my nerves is bad!""
So sad, but I won't think twice
We rich, we get the best judicial advice
Threaten my life with them words that they ut-ter-in'
Adrenaline pump, my heart start to flut-ter-in'
Continuous dump, that tech gets to stut-ter-in'
Left in the slump, mother and sister cud-dle-in'
And for what, 'cause you ego-trippin'
If that thing jam, it's divine intervention

Had to show him that I heard (Let's go...)
All that duct-tape-tie-up talk put in reverse
Now it's him who's in a bind on the account of his words (Yeah, you know it...)
Yeah, they talk 'bout this and that (That...)
Got it fucked up, like I'm all 'bout rap (Rap...)
Word is I'm loaded, they want a piece of that
I respond with four words, ""Rat-tat-tat-tat"" (In yo ass...)
Now, rap about that
I carry a human heat box, to make ya heartbeat stop (Stop...)
Some say Pusha's the coldest
Money is my morals, other than that, I'm soulless
Refuse to wake up zeroless and 0-less
Carry that shit that blow your arm out your shoulders (Bla-oww...)

Keep my heart racin'
Love to take her on vacations
Where the time zone changes and money exchanges
And meters and kilometers on the dials of the ranges
Far away with my Jamacian sexy everyday is like a holiday
The cheeba got me in a slum sleeper
But when I try to leave her I just find out that it's cheaper to keep her
Plus she keep my thoughts deeper, really zonin'
Like my Cali homies 6-4 rollin'
Or them Deroit 'Lacs trimmed in golden
Or my Texas family 150 white strollin'
Damn, I was caught up in the Matrix
But not Keanu Reaves, as she rolls in bamboo leaves

Twist you anytime I feel the need
Love ya touch and how you set my mind at ease
In Virginia where you kept me motionless
From that point on I knew I could never get over this

'cause I'm lovesick, got me all choked up
Look, you keep my head in the clouds mami ,'till I can't breathe
And next to that heat seeker you my main squeeze
Plus I get twistin' didn't even spend my money on
Now either I'm a fool or you really must got me gone
You got me open these days I must admit
Body numbed up and in a slump like I been hit
But luckily it's just the green got me leavin' smoke streams
And blowin' smoke rings as I flee from the scene
Gangsta leanin' in a 850 beamin'

Hard to hold back, scent so sweet
Got to Cognac and honey wrap her this ain't drink
From Taiwanese to Amsterdam greeny green
To hydroponic that make a weak stomach vomit

Listen, at times you hinder my vision
Blinded by ya love and you got the room spinnin'
It's not jealousy the reason why I keep you hidden
Hell, I hit you then I pass you to my man like I do my women

That they've never felt before, c'mon
From ghetto to ghetto, to backyard to yard
I sell it whip on whip, it's off the hard
I'm the neighborhood Pusha
Call me sub woofer, 'cause I pump bass like that, Jack
On or off the track, I'm heavy 'cause
Ball 'til you fall 'cause you could duck to the fetti govs
Sorry my love, what I'm seeing through these eyes
Benz convoys with the wagon on the side
Only big boys keep deuces on the ride
Gucci Chuck Taylor with the dragon on the side
Man, I make a buck, why scram?
I'm trying to show y'all who the fuck I am
The jewels is flirting me, damned if I'm hurting
Legend in two games like I'm Pee Wee Kirkland
Platinum on the block with consistent hits

I bake them cakes as fast as I can
And you can tell by how my bread stack up
And disguised in this rap so the Feds back up
Watch it, like my whip, like my chick, topless
Doing a buck-six with me in the cockpit
Grindin' cousin, I got hoes for a dozen
Even Eleven-5, if I see ya keep it comin'
And my weight, that's just as heavy as my name
So much dough, I can't swear I won't change
Excuse me if my wealth got me full of myself
Cocky, something that I just can't help
'Specially when them 20's is spinning like windmills
And the ice 32 below minus the wind chill
Filthy, the word that best defines me

Glock with two tips, whoever gets in the way
Not to mention the hideaway that rests by the lake
Consider my raw demeanor the icing on the cake, I'm Grinding

Balance weight through the hood
Kids call me Mr. Sniffles, other hand on my nickel
Plated whistle, one eye closed I'll hit you

Uh, huh, oh, damn baby, shit

Rap or a hustler, who rocks is bigger? The rapper
Naw, dog, go figure, with the V12, I make that straight killa
I flood the block, I hug the glock
I have a whole neighborhood that seen a thug to stop
'Cause I show 'em what Waco see
Then hit the district then visit to Jac-o-be
I like my diamonds colored, watch it smothered
Show off at the place of jewels, let the white man love it
I'm too much, got bitches out for me
Bring 'em home, give 'em they choice of balcony

Its hard for a chick not to stick around
When I come through town, layin' my dick down
They can tell a true playa by the clothes that I wear
Game that I spit and the length of my hair
The more I come, the more I cum, get it?
What you see now, I been done did it
Every girl around, I been done hit it
Cars been kited, since I was sixteen
And yes, I'm still spendin' that Kris Kross creme

Speedboat, glass floor, let you see underneath
But never mind that though, I'm just showin' off
As I do in the Porsche show with the top lost
I ain't change the game hash, you know the name as
Malice in my wrist, like shattered stain glass
I generate them Franklin's and Grant's
Each ear look like a halogen lamp
I'm high beamin', at the same time leanin'
In the butter soft seat that keep a street thug scheming'
For we compare paper, get your weight up
I need more points than that, don't you play with me, Jacob

Light up ya world, 'til you start to stagger and shit
Watch how them hollows straight rattle ya shit
And I leave it to y'all, to freestyle and battle and shit

Traits of a blow dealer, cost my fame
I hustle, I'm rich, blow scrilla
I'm the torch that, carry the game
The flame I throw, crack change came from blow
Push the O's, six lay close
Hug the streets, I hug the beat, change flows
Thug the streets, my love is deep, my pain shows
My hearts on a sleeve-a
Nigga that they gave they soul and hearts to mistreat you
Nigga told, they breaking my heart on the streets so
Watch the phonies, watch ya homies

Three guns is fortune, and I don't mind sharing my wealth
Dog, I know about my life
I been around the world thrice times, I mean what I say
From that Panama sun, to France's Champs-ÃlysÃ©es
Grind so deep-rooted, I can't turn away
To sell base is now somewhat therapeutic
Hear what I say, please don't confuse it
My verses heal, like Curt Mayfield's music

And only pull back to cook ya, partner

Hou! Hou! Hou!

I be damned if I die of starvation, things is fucked up as is
So I bangs my cabbage; do you not know the most effective
Way of gettin' money, pull yo gun, rapidly
And watch you see the situation be corrected
Lord Heavens, why must I live so devilish
They say whatcha do comes back on you two times
I shoulda been died, but I'm still walking around wit two nines
Who wants to be a millionaire, me, and you ain't got no more life lines
You a snitch nigga fighting crime, go ahead and tell the police
Cause every move you make, I'mma throw a slug
And hope you choke blood, nigga, on every breath you take
Not to be broke, cause Coldchain fate witness
Naturally spitting from me, human gat, field to the limit
Head to diminish, loud niggas talking gibberish
Grind beef, I deliver it, with complimentary service, for certain
Live in the living room, searching to hurting you

Hypes tryin' to talk with no teeth
Shorties sayin' ball or retreat
A lesson we all speak at one point or another
What you expect from one who smoke a joint with his mother
Anointed hustlers in a fatherless region
Through the pain wish they know that God was just teachin'
We want decent homes
So dreams we say out loud like speaker phones just to keep em on
It's like a colored song that keep keepin' on
I guess knowin' I'm weak is when I'm really bein' strong
Somehow through the dust I could see the dawn
Like the Bishop Magic Juan, that's why I write freedom songs
For the real people
[Verse 2]
I wonder is the spirits of Bob Marley and Haile Selassie
Watch me as the cops be tryin' to and pop and lock me
They cocky, plus they mentality is Nazi
The way they treat blacks I wanna snap like paparazzi
We're the children of a better God searchin' for better jobs
We could cop ghetto cars tryin' not to catch a charge
They say the dope game is sour
Now they doin' homework that's when they follow you for hours
Come to your crib and devour all that you work for
Must be more than paper these niggas hurt for
Through the purple haze I circle days I rhyme that work for pays
Tryna reverse the slave's mind and insert the brave mentality
Heard that it's drama at home
Can a dude break free and still get honored at home
I was told by a chief it's the games nature
When you're glowin' some will love and some will hate ya
It's real people
[Verse 3]
Black men walking wit white girls on they arms
I be mad at em as if I know they moms
Told to go beyond the surface, a person's a person
When we lessen our women our condition seems to worsen
The weary cursin' the sky
Talkin' to themselves givin' the version of why help and hurt in they eye
I live across from it, some of it I do be in
I be showin' niggas lives
Like UPN
It's real people"
testify,2005,common,Hip-Hop,"She walk into the court her knees buckle
Saying for a man to survive he need hustle
Seen and been through struggle her whole life
Made a transition from being his ho to his wife
Stifling, the night upend the ATF bust in
Her daddy was a hustler so she love them
Looked at the jury how can they judge him, she screamed
Before you lock my love away, before you lock my love away
Before you lock my love away, before you lock my love away
Please let me testify
Fear in her chest her face in tears, had her mans back he was facing years
In her name though the place was his
They trying to take everything except the kids
But years she been through scuffles and fights
While he trying to hustle that white
Up all night wondering if he's alive
Seeing him tried she bubbled inside and screamed
Before you lock my love away, before you lock my love away
Before you lock my love away, before you lock my love away
Please let me testify
The judge yelled for order court reporter makin' her words shorter
His lawyer sat next to him, she could see how the trial was affecting him
It hurt for her eyes to connect with him, using her lies for protecting him
They arrested him for murder, and gun possession
As they read back her confession she screamed
Before you lock my love away, before you lock my love away
Before you lock my love away, before you lock my love away
Please let me testify
The court awaited as the foreman got the verdict from the bailiff
Emotional outbursts tears and smeared makeup
He stated, he was guilty on all charges
She's shaking looking like she took it the hardest
A spin artist, she brought her face up laughing
That's when the prosecutor realized what happened
All that speaking her mind testifying and crying
When this bitch did the crime
The queenpin
Before you lock my love away, before you lock my love away
Before you lock my love away, before you lock my love away

You accuse me of a, you accuse me of a, you accuse

corner,2005,common,Hip-Hop,"Memories on the corners with the fo's and the mo's
Walk to the store for the rose, talking straightforward to hoes
Got uncles that smoke, and some put blow up they nose
To cope with the lows, the wind is cold and it blows
In their socks and their soles, niggas holding they rolls
Corners leave souls opened and closed, hoping for mo'
With nowhere to go, niggas rolling in droves
They shoot the wrong way, cause they ain't knowin' their goals
The streets ain't safe cause they ain't knowing the code
By the foes I was told, either focus or fold
Got cousins with flows, hope they open some doors
So we can cop clothes and roll in a Rolls
Now I roll in a Olds, with windows that don't roll
Down the roads where cars get broken and stole
These are the stories told by Stony and Cottage Grove
The world is cold, the block is hot as a stove
On the corners
I wish I could give you this feeling
I wish I could give this feeling
On the corners niggas rob or kill
And dying just to make a living, huh?
We overstated, we underrated, we educated
The corner was our time when time stood still and
Gators and snakeskins and
Yellow and pink and profiles
Street lights and deep nights, cats trying to eat right
Riding no-seat-bikes, with work to feed hypes
So they can get sweet Nike's, they head and they feet right
Desires of street life, cars and weed types
It's hard to breathe nights, days are thief-like
The beasts roam the streets, the police is Greek-like
Game at its peak, we speak and believe hype
Bang in the streets hats cocked left or deep right
It's steep life, coming up where niggas is sheep-like
Rappers and hoopers, we strive to be like
G's with three strikes, seeds that need light
Cheese and recite, needs and BE strife
The corner, where struggle and greed fight
We write songs about wrong 'cause it's hard to see right
Look to the sky, hoping it will bleed light
Reality's a bitch, and I heard that she bites
The corner
I wish I could give you this feeling
I wish I could give this feeling
On the corners niggas rob or kill
And dying just to make a living, huh?
The corner was our magic, our music, our politics
Fires raised as tribal dances and war cries
Broke out on different corners
Power to the people
Black power
Black is beautiful
Black church services, murderers, Arabs serving burgers
As cats with gold permanents, move they bags as herbalists
The dirt isn't just fertile, it's people working and earning this
The curb getters go where the cash flow and the current is
It's so hot that niggas burn to live
The furnace is, where the money moving, the determined live
We talk shit, play lotto, and buy German beers
It's so black packed with action that's affirmative
The corners
I wish I could give you this feeling
I wish I could give this feeling
On the corners niggas rob or kill
And dying just to make a living, huh?
The corner was our Rock of Gibraltar, our Stonehenge
Our Taj Mahal, our monument
Our testimonial to freedom, to peace, and to love
Down on the corner"

[Verse 1]
Night Blows, Stoves don't work, Hoes at work
A warrior, so I wear 'em on my shirt
Wish I was free as Che was, I spend a day buzzed
Tripping on heights, wishing for Nikes in different flavors
The age of Kane and Big Daddy,shown by the caddies
Uncles named Larry, that really never grabbed me
My mother gave birth but she really never had me
Left to the hood to play daddy
Raised by niggaz named Butch through the bay bay
With waists so they weigh they status on the streets
License plates that say they, motto This is Chicago in the hay day
Similar to Good Times, I guess that I was Jay Jay
A skinny nigga, young girls with penny figures
So many niggaz, stacked upon each other
It's the black upon each other that we love so much
Wonder how many of us, these drugs gonna touch
Used to gangbang, ain't really thug that much
Rather have some thick broads then the dutch to clutch
Went to school in Baton Rouge for a couple of years
My college career got downed with a couple of beers
Came back home, now I gotta pay back loans
Same nigga, same block, same shit they own
Only thing different, quicker, they click that chrome
In my defense, yo I had to hit that zone
Man to man, I'm good working with my hands
My generation never understood working for the man
And, of being broke I ain't a fan
Now I stand in the same spot, as my old man
My life I planned not to be on this corner
I still wanna see California
But this is my world
[Chorus Repeated Overlapping:]
""It's your world""
[Common] Yeah
[Verse 2]
Life and death law around us
Four pounds and pounds a verb from out of towners
It's hard to stay grounded
We stay high, that's why old folks down us
Lost, nobody found us, the force that surrounds us
Ain't with us, they get us on the ground and hit us
We paint pictures of the chains under their names and scriptures
Removed from earth, only to return through birth
Knew this girl selling her body, wish she knew what it was worth.
Between God and trash, looking in every car that pass
With a walk that suggests head, to milk niggaz she was breastfed
She know dairy so she say cheese to get bread
In the area where it's more weaves and less dreads
Kinda scary, amongst thieves and base-heads
Said it was her toes, but I could tell her soul hurt
She was cold turk, growing up she got to know hurt
Very well in a world where self hate is overt
Her step-father that he was ike, so her mother he striked
She got to like like minded niggaz, who liked crimes and figures
Doing white lines and liquor, see hard times had kicked her
In the ass, it used to be thicker
Life is fast, some choose to be quicker
I remember in high school she had a passion to sing
Now she see herself in a casket in dreams
These are the children of crack and rap, blacks done lack
Self-esteem, yo we forgot the dream
On our Jefferson's y'all but we forgot the theme
In the Chi, we even rooting for a garbage team
This queen never seen herself on this Corner
She still wanna see California
But this is her world
[Chorus repeated several times]
[Kids stating their dreams]
['POPS']
Be, be here, be there, be that, be this
Be grateful for life, be grateful to life
Be gleeful everyday, for being the best swimmer among 500,000
Be-nign, be you, be mom's mean pie, be little black sambo With bad hair
Be aware of what a lynch is, Be, be boundless energy
Be a four star ghetto general, be no one except I
Be a strong academic student, be an A student in sociology
Be food for thought to the growing mind, be the author of your own horoscope
Be invited, be long-living, be forgiving, be not forgetful
Be a proud run, only to return to fight another day
Be peaceful if possible, but justice in ways (?)
Be high when you low, be on time but knowing to go
Be cautious of the road to college, taking a detour through Vietnam or the middle east
Be absent of wars at any past or present fought amongst themselves
Be visual of foreclosure over your shoulder while begging
A nation built on free labor for reparation, Be a cartopogropher
Be a map maker, be able to find afro-american man
Search thoroughly it may be close to black man
Be ammended 5/5ths, be ammended 5/5ths human
Be the owner of more land than is set aside for wild life
Be cupid, to world government
Be found among the truth, lost tribe
Be at full strength when walking through the valley
Be not foolish as tender 18 of the mountain tops
Be a brilliant soul, sparkling in the galaxy while walking on earth
Be loved by God as much as God loved Gandhi and Martin Luther King
Be that last one of 144,000, be the resident of that twelfth house
Be....eternal!

I rap with the passion of Christ, nigga cross me
Took it outta space and niggas thought they lost me
I'm back like a chiropract wit b-boy survival rap
This ain't '94 Joe we can't go back
The game need a makeover
My man retired, I'ma take over
Tell these halftime niggas break's over
I'm raw hustlers getcha bakin' soda
Too many rape the culture
Leave rappers with careers and their faith over
It's a war goin' on you can't fake bein' a soldier
In the basement listenin' to tapes of Ultramagnetic to the fact the Messiah's black
I turn the TV down we could take it higher than that
I wonder if these wack niggas realize they wack
And they the reason my people say they tired of rap
Inspired by black Muslims and Christian
Pushin' Cutlasses, dope, and other traditions
In the conditions of the city, the city,
Come on
And you say Chi city, we don't stop naw we don't quit
A black figure, in the middle of chaos and gun fire
So many raps about rims, I'm surprised @#%$ ain't become tires
On the street you turn code and then go screech
I tell 'em fuck 'em, like I do the police
The beast in runnin' rampant
I'm in between sheets tryna have sex that's tantric
But the getto, tryna make a get up stand up anthem
You spit hot garbage son of Sanford
What you rappin' for to get fame or get rich
I slap a nigga like you
And tell him Rick James bitch
Witcha Hollywood stories on porches
We poli hood stories on who became rich
And whatever light they hit, we wanna hit the same switch
You didn't know where to aim it, you still remain bitch
I'm forever puttin' words together
Some'll sever mothers from daughters and fathers from sons
The name Com has never been involved in Run
Unless it's DMC or runnin' these broads to bein' free
I'm hotta than the times, you hardly scary
Holdin' gats inside, you cats is Halle Berry
They ask me where hip hop is goin', a Chicagoan
Poetry's in motion like a picture now showin'
It's the city, the city y'all, the city, the city y'all

She was a bad, uh
The type at the club niggas would grab her
Fantasize when I had her in the bathroom sweating with her ass up
The body of a dancer
We had chemistry 'cause she was a cancer
Thought forever it would last for, but forever moved faster so I had to: Go!
Still, I got to pause when I think about her in them drawers
And, ooh baby she liked it raw
And, like rain, when she came it poured
And, like a car I can't afford, I would want it, then want some more
The positions our frames explored let me know she was secure
Back for more

Said I was bait and for me to mack her
Little red Corvette? Naw, she was faster
Wet dreams, Lemair Cream and after
We'd make love and then laughter
And any way I wanted I could have her
Said it was some girls that did attract her
A new chapter she was after, so I said let's go!
To a place that you want to be
Get what you want from her and me, free love I wanna see
Hot sex in the third degree, you're getting served while serving me
Dirty words encourage me to rock steady and sturdily
On you're turning me, no turning back, the further we: GO!

We got to be
(Faithful to thee)
I want to be
(Faithful to thee)
Yes, its for the people, God moves, yeah
I was rollin' around, in my mind it occurred
What if God was a her?
Would I treat her the same? Would I still be runnin' game on her?
In what type of ways would I want her?
Would I want her for her mind or her heavenly body?
Couldn't be out gettin' bogus with someone so godly
If I was wit' her would I still be wantin' my ex?
The lies, the greed, the weed, the sex
Wouldn't be ashamed to give her part of my check
Wearin' her cross, I mean the heart on my neck
Her I would reflect on the streets of the Chi'
Ride wit' her, 'cause I know for me she'd die
Through good and bad call on her like I'm chirpin' her
Couldn't be jealous 'cause other brothers worship her
Walk this earth for her, glory, I'm grateful
To be in her presence I try to stay faithful
Faithful to thee
Faithful to thee
Faithful to thee
I'd like to be her very best friend
He worked with her, she was his lady's best friend
Even if they don't try some ladies test men
And this was a test that was bigger than him
Some believe its the nature that is given to men
He had a good gig, a wife, a kid, a decent home
One reason or another couldn't find peace at home
She asked, ""Why do men always have to stray?""
He said, ""I'm bad, not as bad as Eric Benet""
""I used to take 'em out to eat but they wasn't really eatin'
Mighta got a little head but I wasn't really cheatin'""
It's hard when your lady don't believe what you say
And what you did in the past you gotta live with today
She asked if they could spend the night together
He thought, and said, ""I'm tryin' to get my life together""
Went home to his lady, these were his confessions
""Baby you a blessin' and my best friend""
Faithful to thee
Faithful to thee
Faithful to thee
I'd like to be her very best friend
Faithful to thee

And my baby mama late (uh oh! uh oh! uh oh!)
So I had to did, what I had to did
Cause I had to get (duh-ough! duh-ough! duh-ough!)
I'm up all night, getting my money right
Until the blue and white (po po! po po! po po!)
Now the money coming slow, but a least a nigga know
Slow motion better than (no-oh! no-oh! no-oh!)
[Verse - Common]
You love to hear the story, again and again
About these young brothers, from the City of Wind
Like juice and gin, in the city we blend
Amongst the hustle, titties and skin, fifties and rims
Y'all know the Sprewells and trucks that's detailed
Heartless females that wanna ride in em
Felt the southside venom in raw hides and denim
Pimp minds collide wit em, a system that tries victims
We living in, my man in the fast lane pivoting
On the block white is selling like Eminem
On the block it ""Jump Off"" like Kim and them
On the block it's hot, you can feel it, in your skin and then
Shorties get the game but no instructions to assembling
Eyes bright, it seems like the fight is dimming them
Call my man cuzo, like I'm kin to him
He trying to stay straight, the streets is bending him
[Chorus]
[Verse - Common]
It's all good in the hood, like raps and gems
Throwbacks and Timbs, blacks and rims
Whether on ball courts, attires of all sorts
We never fall short, wit us it's our Force like And 1's
Some waves, some air guns, the days of the fair one is over for
Cats is colder than four below, wit self I go toe to toe
Wondering if it's for the art or for the doe
Though I know to grow a nigga gotta learn to let go
Though I know the doe I got to bring back to the ghetto
Arrows on Terot cards pointing to the grind
Po' livin in more prisons, pointing to my mind, shine the light up
Clench my fists tight, holding the right up
Freedom fight in dark gear for the years to get brighter
Situations, and jobs get tighter
My man trying to get his weight and height up, c'mon!

[Bridge - Kanye West]
I - I know I could make it right
If I could just swallow my pride
But I can't run away or put my gun away
You can't front on me
I - no I can't let it ride
No no not tonight
See I can't run away or put my gun away
You can't front on me
[Verse - Common]
I break bread wit thieves and pastors, OG's and masters
Emcees and actors that seize and capture
Moments like the camcorder
You ain't killin it, yo that's man-slaughter
Though paper can't change a man's aura
It can feed a man's daughter
I stand for the blue collar, on the side making a few dollars
Like Sam Jack they maneuver through drama like

Yo I'm toking on the freedom
Stepping to the A.M., cats be taking in the P.M.
Tell the players I'm the G.M.
Told my team let me get my plays straight, I'ma feed them
They need me like I need them
See the streets is bleeding
Had to meet with my mind on how I could divined
Stay on my climb
I'm grinding, 'til I get blue balls
Everyday, same shit new star
Don't make me act like where I come from because he grew tall
There's a place that to run from it if you neutral
Hustlers and vogues, customers and smokes

Make sure that bitch knock
If you gonna get that glock don't be scared to big shot
Hip Hop is changing, why y'all want me to stay the same?
Sorta like Barkley on how I see the game
I recognize game like a scout
Hey yo, I'm bound to wreck your lady as I turn your lady out
I ain't about that
Messing with no other man's women
Because of jealousy then a man go under
Understand a man and his mental
Listening to Joan Mitchell
With the fan and the window
Can it be so simple then?
I rock Rockports, you rock Timberland's
I want a Rover, but I'm thinking long range
I ain't switch over, I just made my own lane
I want to ride in my car, smoke my shit

Like a pimp to a hoe I connect to the track
I feel it in my neck and my back
A thug came to me, said it changed his life
Said the love of his life, he used to bang to the light
I'm trying to do better
I ain't claiming Mister Right
I'm a grown man, I'm too old to fist-fight
I stay on point like trick dice
Tweaking like the sound man who need to switch mike
Sounding bitch like
I know the block is hot, but we just can't get ice
When our children's children sit nice?
I sing the song to make the fiend's strong
King Kong ain't got shit on me
I train days to rip emcees, I'm peaking
But I still gotta get that cheese
You on some monkey ball damn chimpanzees
Mobbing through the Chi-Town to feel the breeze yo

come-close,2002,common,Hip-Hop,"It's just a fly love song, what
Are we living in a dream world?
Are your eyes still green girl?
I know your sick and tired of arguing
But you can't keep it bottled in
Jealousy, we got to swallow it
Your heart and mind baby follow it
Smile, happiness you could model it
And when you feel opposite
I just want you to know
Your whole being is beautiful
I'm going to do the best I can do
Cause I'm the best when I'm with you
Come close to me baby
Let your love hold you
I know this world is crazy
What's it without you
Put down your bags love

Has been sort of hard in you
But I see the God in you
I just want to nurture it
Though this love may hurt a bit
We dealing wit this water love
You even give my daughter love
I want to build a tribe wit you
Protect and provide for you
Truth is I can't hide from you
The pimp in me
May have to die with you
Come close to me baby
Let your love hold you
I know this world is crazy
What's it without you
I know what you're thinking, you're on my mind
You're right, you're right, you're right
You promise so fast you just might take flight
Hope your not tired, tonight, tonight
You help me to discovery me
I just want you to put trust in me
I kind of laugh when you cuss at me
The aftermath is you touching me
It's destiny to we connected girl
You and I we can affect the world
I'm tired of the fast lane
I want you to have my last name
Come close to me baby
Let your love hold you
I know this world is crazy
What's it without you
I know what you're thinking, you're on my mind
You're right, you're right, you're right

star-69-ps-with-love,2002,common,Hip-Hop,"Let's do it now, it's me and you
Close my eyes Erotica, I'm seein' you
Listen to me wishin' I could be with you
To share my love and ecstasy with you
Are you alone? Is your shorty asleep?
Hold on, that's okay, ignore the beep
For you, my love is immortal deep
You are my queen but I can't ignore the freak
Let's let our bodies talk and our auras speak
Hold on, gotta get the toiletries
As our waters reach distances unheard of
I'm in the room nestled sweet and I observe love
Only for you, I ask God to show me the truth
What he showed me was you
Wherever I go, my soul leads to you
Days gone, nights lonely for you
Erotica, wet dreams are on my mind
Erotica, can I come in your mind?
Erotica, oh yes, with love I shine
Erotica, wish on star *69, Erotica, wish on star *69
Erotica, wish on star *69, Erotica
So much I wish you were here with me now
My bad, I just hit redial
I want you to come and never leave now
Is your mind and your right hand free now?
Our love reach deep down inside of it
As the candle burns, where desire's lit
Makin' love knows no distance or environment
When we ah, feel the most high in it
I feel you touchin' me and I begin to rise from it
Your love is stuck in me, our minds are so alive and thick
Picture my hands on your waist as I stare in your face
Your mouth half open, your love I can taste
Embracin' you, life, I let go
Gotta switch phones 'cause this one is ghetto
Another level of love we create when we take it to
And when it's made, Erotica, it's made for you
Erotica, wet dreams are on my mind
Erotica, can I come in your mind?
Erotica, oh yes, with love I shine
Erotica, wish on star *69, Erotica, wish on star *69
Erotica, wish on star *69, Erotica
Slave to your loneliness
(Slave to your loneliness)
Inside of loneliness
(Inside this, alt we bear)
With love of loneliness
(With thoughts of loneliness)
Enslaved by loneliness
([Incomprehensible])
I want you to come inside your mind
And find a place nasty and kind
This is where our desires grind
And where they peak Is most divine
A place and time, I hope we reach together
You are my queen and freak forever
I feel you inside my stomach
My body shakes
Wet dreams are on my mind, Erotica
Can I come in your mind? Erotica
Oh yes, with love I shine, Erotica
Wish on star *69, Erotica, wish on star *69, Erotica
Wish on star *69
Wish on star *69
Wish on star *69

heaven-somewhere,2002,common,Hip-Hop,"Phone rang, screen said caller ID said blocked
But for some reason I decided to answer it
On the other end was a French accent
He told me we needed to rap quick
Cause he had did some bad shit
And would be gone for years, spending these last two days
With his momma and his kids
When he spoke I wasn't trying to hear it ,cause
I knew he was a real good person
And this didn't seem like it was in his spirit
He couldn't believe as much as I couldn't, what he done
He said now its time for him to turn himself in
No longer could he run, from life, from God
Start thinkin', why is doing right is so hard
I got back to him when we was in London discussin' the new testament
And how our lives related to it, and how we could make the best of it
My voice became destined, so I asked him why you gotta go
He said you know turn to Matthew twenty-four
He said no one knows the hour, nor do they know the day
But the kingdom is near, don't let anything lead you to stray
As long as God is with you, everything will be okay
So right about then, we decided to pray
Just lyin' back makin' the smoke disperse a ray
Deep into clouds
It's makin' things appear to me so clearly
Deep in the clouds
Just lyin' back makin' the smoke disperse a ray
Deep in the clouds
It's makin' things appear to me so clearly
Deep into clouds
Your time
Is a terrible to waste
For it's
Not one of the possessions that you can bring to space, yeah, it don't matter
Its a challenge
But the chance of seeing, is quite a dream to chase, yes it is
I hope
I remind God of him when he sees my face
He goin' see it
The feeling just keeps on lifting me higher
And its ever flowing it's, ever flowing
When every thing, puts a smile on my face
And I recognize the strong goal
But I keep on going, I keep on going
I keep on going on
Hey mighty love
Watching over me
A smile, brilliant
All over, constantly
Warm, comforting
Perfect, like nothing
No hate, no confusion, no strain
Simply peace, simply
Simply, simply, simply
No fear! Heaven is to me
No fear of destruction
Understanding who he is
His name is Christ
Heaven, heaven is to me
Wisdom, understanding, knowledge
Streets of gold and pearly gates
Halos wings all dressed in white
Angels sing and cymbals glare
No one's rich no one's poor
People dreaming they live free
Making love while they in love
Wonderful dream wake me when you're home
Heaven, heaven is being pops
Heaven is spending the day with your grandchildren
Listenin' to they voices when and they laughing and play
And then at the end of the day we hug we kiss and slowly they walk away
And then suddenly they turn and rush back to me and hug me round the knees
Yeah, that's heaven to me"
i-am-music,2002,common,Hip-Hop,"Candy sweet, your words of bedtime
I was just saying to myself the other day
Most don't believe in the magician, but you're bewitching
Because of this I must say
I, I, I appreciate what you give to me, yeah
I, I appreciate what you give to me, yeah
People say I got soul, look at all the records I hold
The lives I've affected, connect and control
With me in your basement your mama got blown
I provide the vibe to keep the strippers on poles
Through me the black experience is glorious told
From a school that's old, bold, so I rock gold
And platinum, some cats I hold notes and cash for them
On streets I rap with them, in ghettos I blast for them
Mash with them, at the party and all
Be the universal language that's embodying all
Put the Billie Holiday, Bob Marley in y'all
Y'all feel most high when I be in y'all
System, with the rhythm I up jump the boogie
Shame I rely on record labels to push me
Since the bush, I been y'all way to escape
Through eight-tracks, wax, CD's and tapes
I am music
Candy sweet, your words of bedtime
I was just saying to myself the other day
Most don't believe in the magician, but you're bewitching
Because of this I must say
I, I, I appreciate what you give to me, yeah
I, I appreciate what you give to me, yeah
You can feel me all over alive, I help culture survive, I opened the eyes of many
Styles y'all wrote in the skies, with your lows and highs, open your mind to hear me
In the streets I beat cops and obsolete
On every station it's hot, you can't stop my heat
I taught Jay and Dre how to rock the beat
On what's going on today, yo, I gots to speak
I take the stand, yo, you could feel me bam
Whether in Larry Graham or Steely Dan
Live I be killing it man
For how long I survived yo I'm realer than man
Got a soft side but I'm still a man
For me women cry and children dance, I'm trying to eat
I could'a got a mil and ran
But like Sly for the fam still I stand
I am music
Candy sweet, your words of bedtime
I was just saying to myself the other day
Most don't believe in the magician, but you're bewitching
Because of this I must say
I, I, I appreciate what you give to me, yeah
I, I appreciate what you give to me, yeah
I been here since the beginning
Beginning of time, yo, beginning of time
Deep in the mind of the ancient ones
Everybody love me like they do the sun
I shine at times, yo, at times I'm dark
You can't categorize me, my mind's a art
Inside my heart, it ain't about climbing charts
I'm the one you roll with when you're riding smart
The change that came, the change that comes
I change with chords and I kick it with drums
Get blow with horns and did it on the one
Riffed for guitars, for the Lord I sung
Spun around the world at parties and weddings
Wherever I go, I create the setting
You know me from lessons or your pop's collection
Whether whole or half stepping, I'm a blessing
Yo, I am music
Candy sweet, your words of bedtime
I was just saying to myself the other day
Most don't believe in the magician, but you're bewitching
Because of this I must say

between-me-you-liberation,2002,common,Hip-Hop,"She rested her head upon my chest
Sensed liberation in between breaths
Wonder if sex is what she found it in
Peace, found it laying down with men
Wasn't there to judge her, many ways I loved her
It was more than bodies we shared with each other
We laid under the cover of friends
A place where many lovers began
I began, to feel her body shake in my hand
Body language, it's so hard trying to understand
Usually after sex, it's a good feel
Took by silence, emotion stood still
I could feel, her tears spill, from her grille
Hurt from before that began to build
She told me hold me, a story she assembled it
Telling it, trying not to remember it
It was a story of innocence taken
Thought she could redeem, through love making
When she was eight she was raped by her father
And tried to escape through multiple sex partners
Felt pitiful, she had only learned,
To love through the physical, inside it burned
My heart turned, I thought of what this man did
She forgave him, she grew to understand it
Her soul was tired and never really rested
Only with men through aggression
Said it was a blessing and it happened for a reason
By speaking it, she found freedom
Between me and you
[Chorus: Cee-Lo]
Sometimes I wish a, careless whisper
Serenade her, without speaking a word
Because of you I'm stronger, I'm afraid no longer
I feel so alive in me, you have liberated me
She laid, I watched her breathe
Happy to be here, not afraid to leave
I couldn't conceive her not being here
Death in her face her not having fear
Less than a year she was diagnosed with it
Memories of that year, so close and vivid
Happiness, would only visit, once in a while
To watch an adult, becoming a child
Somehow, I knew she'd make it
The life of one so given early would God take it?
Hurt she placed in, hope and prayer
Hurt she placed in chemo and lost hair
I stare with my eyes closed
Wonder when the body leave does the mind go
Watching Jordan became less important
Seeing this disease eat away my aunt's organs
According to doctors there's no cure
We went through doubt, and cases of insure
Wish I knew then how to heal with herbs
Knew a part of her I could heal with words
But the Creator was sending for her
What seemed like the end was the beginning for her
Like that, she didn't want us to remember her
No more medication did she want us to give to her
It spread from her liver to her lungs to her last breath
Only to be freed through death
Between me and you
[Chorus]
He spoke with his eyes, tear-filled
A lump in his throat, his fear built
My whole life it was in steel
This ain't the way that men feel
A feeling, he said he wish he could kill
A feeling, not even time could heal
This is how real life's supposed to be?
For it to happen to someone close to me?
So far we'd come, for him to tell me
As he did, insecurity held me
I felt like he failed me
To the spirit, yelled help me
I'd known him for like what seemed forever
About going pro we dreamed together
Never knew it would turn out like this
For so long he tried to fight this
Now there was no way for him to ignore it
His parents found out and hated him for it
How could I judge him? Had to accept him if I truly loved him
No longer he said had he hated himself
Through sexuality he liberated himself
Between me and you
[Chorus]
Liberation

the-hustle,2002,common,Hip-Hop,"[Common]
My eyes watch God from a place
Where times is hard, hard times we embrace
Everybody want a yard, cuz a yard means space
Being broke is odd and leaves an odd taste
In the mouth of the metropolitan
The hustle is hollarin'
Beautiful minds grind, grind for the dollarin'
Whether dice scholarin' or white collarin'
We all taught hustle to prophet like Solomon
The young play corners, Sean Jean modelin'
They get it from they momma, black music is fatherin'
Blue and whites flash lights like parliment
In court non-whites, wishin' they had Cocharan
Tell your guy and them, yo the blocks hot again
Aunties walking to liquor stores in moccasains
My guy got a gig, on the side he barberin'
Married a foreign chick so she could get a green card up in the hustle
[Chorus: Common (Omar)]
Just put it in your back and hustle
The paper's stacked so hustle
(Gon'! Gon' get it and get me that
Gon'! Gon' get it and get me that
Just move, and shake, and grind and hustle
It's on your mind so hustle
(Gon'! Gon' get it and get me that)
Gon'! Gon' get it and get me that
[Dart Chillz]
First to the third, I'm close to the curb
Toast to the bird, now I'm posted to serve
Heard is a verb when you pour dirt on the floor
Bill collectors and the roaches working your nerves
It's a ghetto truck for a ghetto boy
To get in them ghetto streets and get him a ghetto toys
So he can come so just work murder rate is increasin'
I don't give a fuck long as my coke is decent
And my rims blind the whole damn precinct
Every time you see a head in my lap you know she sinked
I know I'm dead in this trap, that's not how we think
Fifty shells all around on the ground, can't catch a weak blink
Five went through me, two stayed in me to do my duty
Only thing that subdued me
Two weeks, same corner, new freaks
New geese, all white AND 1's new sneaks
[Chorus]
[DJ Joe Sinista scratches bridge]
""Can't knock the hustle!"" ""The Hustle!"" ""I'm in""

Some rhyme, some throw shows, some sow clothes
Some hobo at the junction inbetween cars
Some enter in functions inbetween stars
Some teach, some preach saying they seen God
Some put they money up, against me odds
Flippin' real estate yo, stocks and bonds
Dreams of rollin El Derado's bumpin' El DeBarge
Whatever the dreams, stay on ya deem the world is ours, its the hustle

new-wave,2002,common,Hip-Hop,"Yeah! The war zone. Who you fighting for?
[Verse 1: Common]
It's funk to rhythm and punk to rock
Loud like shot that come from a glock
Pick up your mind, run from the spot
Revolution jumping in the parking lot
Shit is so hot that the sun watch
Children by the window with the gun cocked
They could get robbed and stop the luck (?)
Monkeys dance around for MTV spots
I lock into a,
Rock into a rhythm of street and ancient wisdom
Experiment in stereo loud so crank the system
For the humble on the path I paint a vision
How far will a nigga go just for attention
And to be remembered, you forgot the mission
Listen!
[Chorus: Laetitia Sadier]
All traces of life
In our gats we carry
That's used to dress humanity
(iIt's a New Wave, Come on!)
[In French]
All traces of life
In our gats we carry
That's used to dress humanity
(It's a New Wave, Dig it!)

This life is precious
It's goddamn? marvelous
Before it ever ends
(Common: it's a New Wave, Come on!)
This life is precious
It's goddamn? marvelous
Before it ever ends
(Come on! Come on!)
[Verse 2: Common]
I lay terror in this era like Che Guevera
For the people to make or wait it's better
In a room called real I stay forever
Everyday I lose something I gain forever
Meditate on how I can change the weather
My brainstorm for some it's like umbrella
Where bullets and lies both spray together
My mind scream like Al Green ""Let's Stay Together""
How could a nigga be so scared of change
That's what you hustle for, for the currency exchange
Y'all rich, we could beef curry in the game
Out your mouth, ain't nobody hurrying my name
You seen what happened when the Com go bang
Wouldn't have a shot, even at a gun range
Seen hype become fame against the grain become main-stream
It all seems mundane in the scope of things
[Chorus]
[Verse 3: Common]
From a land of shit talk, boy stars and pitch forks
Didn't really see white until I went North
Getting bent on backyards, wishing in the air for a black god
Where people fix cars and clap hard
And look to the stars for rap jobs
I walk through the black fog with reflectors on my boots
Smelling war near, I'm connected with the troops
That master anger and ain't afraid to shoot
Through poured liquor fallen angels they salute (Whew! Whew!)
Feel the wind blow
A new wave people with their hair trimmed low
It's two ways living in this world of techno
This age can't really save the ghetto
I pause for the rebels who rock heavy metals
And tell them that they're pharaoh so let go
Come on!
[Chorus]"
aquarius,2002,common,Hip-Hop,"Yeah!
Yeah!
Nigga deep in the rhythm, experience speak
Some keepin' the wisdom, the life hustlers seek
I seeking it with em, i'm dope the streets need me to hit em
With some of that (revolutionary rap)
Revolutionary blunted rap
My peoples want hits, I hit it from the back
Under the cherry moon, I hold notes and carry tunes
My guise pack heat enough to bury June, on my feet
I'm getting married soon, walking in the clouds like Mary Bethune
Fumes of a real nigga seep into your room
Or through fifteens of the your jeep that you boom
Son so many cats, they call me high noon
Offerings to Osun hoping war is over soon
Guard your grill like George Foreman
Time to build, as far as building I'm the doorman, opening doors
My blood I expose on the floors, tell them the game ain't only the score
Hold on to your life as I carry these styles
To have you tapping your head like Darius Miles
You ain't supposed to rhyme, better off with a clothing line
In this business of pimps, many hoes get signed
Opposed to shine so me holding the blinds
Mixing golden seal and wine, holding a nine
In the age of Aquarius
The water that arrives (ba-ba ba ba)
To purify the world (du-ba ba ba)
Flying through the night (du ba-ba ba ba)
So watch out here he comes ( do-do ba ba ba)
Aquarius!
Between churches and liquor stores, my mic leaks
With raps, all over your head like Tweet
Playing with yourself, thinking the game is just wealth
Hot for a minute, watch your name just melt
Same spot where it's joyous, where the pain is felt
As you build and destroy yo remain yourself
They say I'm slept on, now I'm bucking in dreams
And rhyme with the mind of a hustler scheme
Or the struggle of fiends, I flow over water that's as troubled as teens
For the love of the team, trying to double the dream
Be grateful like the church psalm my grandmother sings
I'm rubbing my rings across the domes of clones
Punchlines like Roy Jones with poems
While you and your dogs foam at the mouth
Thinking rap is the only way out
The black human genius will never play out
I take you way out, where you never been before
Been it since birth, sent to replish the Eatrh
That truck that you roll is like a miniature hearse
I deaded your shit before you finished a verse
From niggas to gods from bitches to earths
From Nat to Truck Turner that lives in my verse
Realness is an act that you cannot rehearse
Holla back, but listen first
We in the age of Aquarius
The water that arrives (ba-ba ba ba)
To purify the world (du-ba ba ba)
Flying through the night (du ba-ba ba ba)
So watch out here he comes ( do-do ba ba ba)
Aquarius!
The water that arrives (ba-ba ba ba)

Nigga breath can tell by how you rap you don't believe
Ain't hungry no mo' so off me you feed
I hustle at a speed between greed and need
On the streets where intuition and weed are breed
Shoot the gift and viff, at the myths uplift
My rhyme the clip its like the boom bip to tip(q)
In gangways where cats that rhyme the same way
Spending nites over Egypt to learn a brave day
Paint a picture of the ghetto like JJ
You the Ray J Of this rap world
I travel the globe with a black girl name Becky
Grand like Auto Theft 3
Style so developed the law can't arrest me
You walk with blood on your shirt
Like Jesse Jackson trying to test the reaction of the people
See through trying to out act Don Cheadle
I speak to original Hebrew s you know how we do
And bleed through the needle with truth
That needs no preview to proof its in the people
And how they react still in the business of smacking
Rappers is wack you had a dope track I guess opposites
attract my mind state is black
Black like bernie mack no cowards soul power in the words we rap
Picks with fist, thick grease, dark nipples
My guy buy ice I search for the dark crystal
Racing for paper these broads is starter pistols
I spit through gang wars and strange doors
Out the sky flames pour the beats claims war
I see niggaz with flags who they waving them for?
I'm the nigga that you put the chain on the door for
The nigga that you started changing the laws for
Orator of hard-core and more
My raps the portal for the blue collar
Than made a hit and came up on a few dollars
I'd rather listen to silence then you holla
Borrowed your persona from the late that made dear mama
My realness is my armor that I wear up in this boy
For truth your a decoy
Common Sense is like the future of the Bee-boy
I fall down and get up like Don McClerken
Hit puss and listen to it whistle while I'm trerkin
Break it down like herb
The nympho of info I'm fucking what you heard
You ain't ready for war your stuck in the reserves
I mastered my high so I'm bucking at the birds
I been wanted to fly so now I do it with the words
For those in the fast-lane I show you how to merge
Get your own you see its like home grown herb black economics
The people we serve with Soul Power"

Could run up on ya on any corner

How I stuff bricks in the 6, with no crack aroma
Dawg, I'm just livin' for the moment
I'm from Compton homey, but I'm like a center for Milwaukee
'Cause I plays for the bucks and I keep the 40 on me
Gotta keep the chrome-y, gotta keep my back to the wall
Wait for Q to rock me up, like cavi dawg

And watch my money come back like Jordan in charge
I'm like the black Yankees, they don't want me around no more
'Cause I hold the record for the most fiends roamin' the boulevard

Put your kids on the line and give your wife up?

And you don't want it when the stainless out

All over Frisco and Compton dawg, we ruthless
And the truth is y'all niggaz can't stop us dawg
So why the fuck you wanna knock us off?

And y'all really the niggaz that's soft
Still across the train tracks, we turn 'caine crack

intro,2004,game,Hip-Hop,"A lot of people are advocated
That the rich gets richer and the poor gets poorer.

And the quality of your living depends entirely
Upon your ability to play the game,

I'm from Compton, Compton, Murderville
You heard these niggas is gangsters, and they kill
Rob and steal, my niggas will peel at will
For real they real, niggas goin' feel this steel
Walk with me through the ghetto where the packs get sold
And them niggas sellin' the work ain't half as old
as the fiends and the hippies, same ones smokin' since the 60's
Everybody yellin' gimme, gimme
Every nigga in the hood, one hand on his jimmy
Other hand grip the semi, come on walk with me
Every ten houses, one got 'caine for sale
And I give you a dope track like my name Phar-rell
And you can get that stainless steel
Walk in my Chuck Taylors for a day, if you think it ain't f'real
When I buy rocks homey baguettes on my ring
And only neighborhood watch is my Tecno Marine
Keep a (Mac) on the block, I ain't talkin 'bout Beans
QB in the hood and I'm far from Queens
The boys in the hood is always hard
So come through and get smoked like a Cuban cigar
[Chorus]
I'm from Compton, Compton, a block from hell
And you can come get a bird for eleven
And we ain't got a penny for the reverend, a dime for a witness
Only (Church's) in the hood sell chicken (ba-KAW)
Every nigga in the hood sell chickens move work like city buses
You fuckin' with the Hub City Hustler
The vans on the block won't touch us, the streets my home
So I move weight on the block like I'm Moses Malone
Bring the guns anywhere I roam, go with the chrome
And I hit all my shots, like I'm in the A.I. zone
And mob like Al Capone through N.W.A.'s home
Homes like Ed Jones will cripple your team up
In the home of Dr. Dre, Venus and Serena
Where 14-year-olds pack ninas and drive Beamers
We ball up subpeonas, take niggas to the cleaners
And you know what I'm talkin' about if y'all seen where..
[Chorus]
We drug dealin', but niggas is squealin' (fuck you rats)
What more can I say, just kill 'em
Fuck 'em, the gun bust 'em, we just knock on wood
Now is this under-stood?
I mostly George when I whip, my supply is good
The man behind the bricks, I'm supplyin' the hood
Catch bodies like Pistol Pete passes on the wood
Benz parked by the fence, brick stashed in the hood
Top work by the inch, I bag it, it's gone
Ask Quik, we rock more than microphones
Some niggas ball, some niggas do what we do
And other niggas sing for Cash Money like TQ
The block will heat and sink you (hey dude)
Cali ain't all palm trees, purple haze and sea dude
Lose your life tryin' to get these jewels
I keep the 40 cal wrapped in chrome like R2-D2

And I talkin' 'bout a movie or George Clooney

They can't cop what the bricks'll cost
But we stay in the lane to maintain in the 6 to floss
Leather gloves with the tips to toss
But the money was made from conversation had to clip the boss
Smash down at the V.I.P.
Street smarts is crucial for young niggaz in the CX-3
Drop Jag with the price to pay
Cause the bags was heavy my chain swangin like a ice capade
Got the feds lookin twice this way
Cause we shuffle the P's in different places that the {?} name
Compton to Fillmoe man the game is real
When you turn 15 get your stainless steel
Whole squad been trained to kill, we official
And switch to get rich now we after the meals
Hard times got cakes for 3
When it's havin a bundle we break bread for the safe and flee nigga

I got guns, guns, guns, guns
Guns all over the club
We in V.I.P. strapped, security know that
25 deep, guns up under the throwback
That new R. Kelly shit sound like Bobby Womack
Black Wall Street in HURR, nigga where the hoes at
We got sour diesel, three cases of Hypnotiq
And more guns than the Nickerson Projects
Niggaz don't want beef with me
Cause they know they gotta pay for talkin shit but the sheets is free
And ain't nuttin to shoot the club up
You don't want drama in this motherfucker throw them dubs up
Jacob got the wrists on chill
And N.W.A. chain glow like the memory of Ill Will
Relax your mind and let your drawers feel free
You're now rollin to the sound of the Game and JT

But you can't come with the rest of her friends
Cause you know I'm a boss and won't play cause she short on my ends
Make rounds from the back of the Benz
With the {?} that kid with frog eyes with the corners to bend
The things we go through I'm beatin ya brains
Got some homies next do' and I picked up the Game
While they knockin on the do' I get deep in ya dame
Gotta charge you a G just for speakin my name

I'm not eatin your chocha or payin for the coach ma
I'm a pimp like 50, the nigga to leave you broke ma
6 in the mornin, you stretchin on the sofa
Singin ""Ain't No Nigga"" like Foxy Brown and Hova
I fuck 'em dogstyle with Billys and Novas
With or without chaffeurs, I make 'em fuck the both of us
You know what it is, the gangster's back

Pictures gettin old, my lil' girl lookin grown now
Your moms said you're talkin on your own, walkin on your own now
Run across the kitchen floor in them baby drawers
I sent you from off tour and I miss you when I was tourin
Smilin at them baby pictures, so happy, tears pourin
God how can somethin so beautiful come from me?
After the gunshots thought you was done with me
But I know I'm livin now, why you made me put the guns down
Pick up the mic, start rappin for a living now
My sun, my moon, my starts, my earth
My wind, my fire, my life, my bay-bay
Tryin to make your moms life ya must be crazy, fussin and fightin
I know she love me cause ya look just like me
Day you came into this world I was so excited
Eleven twenty-one double-zero, my baby girl is here

And the first time I heard your voice I prayed to God it had to be true
Got a son now, cuttin the game, stoppin the bullshit
Remember eyein your enemy, can you pull quick
Dipped out Cali, came back, snatched my son
my girl moms and I moved out Maui
Yeah your pops gone bananas, seen wild went hard
Bigger house, wider yard, nappy with the crash bar
Off that hersh', shit you stupid, you ain't no dad nigga
Takin your black ass to court for all you have nigga
You see me and your moms, that's another topic
Ain't no whip in this world with a price you can't cop it
Stop it, press rewind, you didn't hear me right
It's a lesson to the song, I'm tryin to steer you right
Just remember your father taught you to go hard or go home
Never sing that sad song, don't cry

Huh daddy ain't gon' preach to you, I'ma let your moms school you
Don't let the streets fool you, streets'll do you, that's why I'm talkin to you

Never turn your back on your foes, them dudes cowards

Some days sweet, and some sour - but we gon' make it together
The world is ours, and you're my flower

If it's ice you can get that, model chicks hit that
Never stress about the downfalls just 'bout the getback

And I ain't sayin sex is wrong, just make sure he strap a condom on
And never, ever do it in your mother's home

Yeah, never call a girl a bitch, show respect, son pop ya collar
Ain't nothin free, scrape and lock every dollar

Balls faster than Roger Clemens nigga you're too big for your bitches
Two gold albums and I'll make you a hitter
Might make you a little richer but don't forget the big picture
All of those make you a fag but money like Little Richard
Take your faggot ass picture put it next to Gulliany
Run you for your Roc-A-Wear fit and beat you with the Tommy
Drag your ass down to Alby Square
Call Beans, Jay, Freeway, Biggs, Dame I'll be there
Compton behind me ask Nas queens is with me
You ain't never sold crack in your life I'm takin' your fiends with me
My guns smoke like Robert Downey
Two shots and a pound he got a room in Kings County
And you might live or sit in a box
Dependin' on how long it NYPD to respond to the shot
Memph Bleek, Memph Bleek, Memph Bleek
Memph Bleek, Memph Bleek, Memph Bleek
See what the problem is too much east coast dick lickin'
And everybody tryin' to do their best 2Pac rendition
Listen they wonder how I live with 5 shots
Niggaz is hard to kill on my block
When you was in the streets comin' of age
I was in the streets pumpin' the gauge
While you was rappin' I was makin' it happen
On the block with a k
While you was with The Roc on the stage
I had rocks on the stage
On headliner for the front page we know that you front
You be on sunset doin' what? Gettin' your punk ass stunt
You gon respect us or that fo' rippin' through the vests
And you know who you are deaf nigga'll get the message

And stop Memphis from rappin' dude, huh

It took me a little while but I am now understandin'
Jay fucked up in the first round when he picked olo with candy
Did olo in the second, nigga take it from me
The Roc get knocked off the bounce till you picked up beans
Add freeway to the team but move the ugly bitch
Trade the Marcy reject for Cam'ron and Lil' Chris
Now the squad 5 is live 6 man is Neef
Fans in the stand yellin' out fuck Memphis Bleek
You want beef I have your body parts all over New York
Leg in jersey arm in Brooklyn head buried in central park
You can't even borrow from New York no more like John Storch
And I ain't talkin' to him I'm talkin' to Malik
And I got a pine box for a nigga like you
Streets is talkin' how many real niggaz like you

They got us choppin' up game through the fog and smoke
We came a long way but still we got so far to go
You [unverified] like Sammy did Gotti, told 'em we kamikaze
Like those whiteboys ain't heedin the robbery
Told 'em we ride around in them cars on them big wheels
In the killin' field makin' 100 bills on the P-700 Pirelli wheels
Marshall Faulk in to ball again in this day to day scrimmage
'Bout the spinach this game is relentless where we livin'
Niggaz'll 32 round ya, kick you on the ground
After they down ya, sneak ya and plot ya, Heckler & Koch ya
Got ya body bein' scrutinized by a flock of doctors
Still an unsolved mystery, statistically, history
A Get Low nigga victory by fuckin' with my credibility"
im-looking,2004,game,Hip-Hop,"I'm from Compton where them guns bust, watch Poppa George pop
Cats tellin' jokes at them car games seen big face hundreds
Handle the rock like Nate Archibald, what? This nigga only sixteen
And I wanted to be, just like him middle school fightin'
Any nigga with a chip on his shoulder, whattup nigga?
You want beef with me? Now I let the heat speak for me
No more talkin', just outline chalkin'
Nigga witta attitude from birth, 100 Miles and Running
Gunnin' bustin' shots like fuck the cops
Notorious for burnin' blocks, weavin' in and out of traffic and chop
Game the young Robin Hood of the block
Steal from the rich, give to the poor, coward niggaz rock
Second comin' of this black Alfred Hitchcock
Kick in the door wavin' the four-four
Ten shots to your spleen
Let them violins sing
Yo, I'm just a ghetto nigga stuck in this game
Young'uns runnin' with 'caine
Rain hits so we floodin' the game
When you come to Compton respect the grounds, leave you shook man
(And I look good, from Compton to Brooklyn)
Hey yo I don't give a fuck who you are, fuck ya ice
Fuck the block that you claim, fuck your Bentley Azure
(Dead presidents is all I represent)
('Til y'all met me y'all niggaz ain't met gangsta yet)
Fast cars, money and muscle, the hustle I was brought up in the 80's
Gangbangin', dope traffic, shit get crazy
From where niggaz grow up hard like dicks raised
Them hustlin' guns like nicks players, we got mouths to feed
'Til they put flowers on me, moms kiss my cold cheek
In that pine box, I'm buyin' rocks, eyein' cops
Fuck a cell block, the young kid makin' it happen
Who you think got them fiends runnin' back like Bo Jackson?
I'm a gangsta, what else could I say?
I'm ahead of myself like it's Y4K
2Pac, Scarface, N.W.A.
Taught me how to dodge them bullets, keep my wig in play
Keep fo' snug in the waist or pay a thousand to have 'em
Niggaz in the street move faster than, Michael Jackson's album
But the shit don't really matter to me, we get better G
Bet the four slow 'em down like PCP
Yo, I'm just a ghetto nigga stuck in this game
Young'uns runnin' with 'caine
Rain hits so we floodin' the game

Hey yo I don't give a fuck who you are, fuck ya ice
Fuck the block that you claim, fuck your Bentley Azure
(Dead presidents is all I represent)
('Til y'all met me y'all niggaz ain't met gangsta yet)
Real gangsters never talk shit, handle they business
Fuck the dry snitchin' and bitchin', niggaz die when them bullets fly
Who fuckin' with him, ha? Not a nigga alive
End up dead in that 5
He got no sympathy for them dead guys, friend or foe
Watch that chest cave in, what that vest savin'?
Make it sloppy for the autopsy, leave my enemies in a frenzy
On the front lines holdin' a 9
Everyday a new chapter, my own niggaz plottin' on me
Tryin' to hit me but they won't get me
Feel the semi first fuckin' with my dough, is the worst way to go
Y'all know, niggaz cry when them bullets burn slow dummy
In and out of spots watchin' my money
If one dollar come up missin' bodies start to come up missin'
No one too heavy for the expedition, piss on your corpse
Watch your soul shiver, throw him in the river, bitch nigga
Yo, I'm just a ghetto nigga stuck in this game
Young'uns runnin' with 'caine
Rain hits so we floodin the game

Three years later the album is done
Aftermath presents: Nigga Witta Attitude, Volume One
Rap critics politickin, wanna know the outcome
Ready to Die, Reasonable Doubt and Doggystyle in one
I feel like 'Pac after the Snoop Dogg trial was done
Dre behind that G series and All Eyez on Me
I watched the death of a dynasty, so I told Vibe Magazine
Workin' with Dr. Dre was a (dream)
I had visions of makin a classic, then my world turned black
Like I was starin' out of Stevie Wonder's glasses
It's kinda hard to imagine, like Kanye West
Coming back from his fatal accident to beatmaking and rapping
But, we the future, Whitney Houston told me that
And it's gon' take more than a bullet in the heart to hold me back
Blushin' in this 40 ounce, lettin' the ink from my pen bleed
Cause Martin Luther King had a (dream)
Aaliyah had a (dream), Left Eye had a (dream)
So I reached out to Kanye and (I brought you all my dreams)
(Cause I love you, I love you, I love you)
I had dreams of fuckin' a R&B; bitch like Mya
When I saw that ass on the front of that King
Read the article in the magazine, she loved gangsters, loved nasty things
So I'm in the glass house having nasty dreams
Good girls never give it up
But anything is possible, if 50 fucked Vivica
Hurdled life's obstacles, found my way through the maze
Then joy turned to pain like Frankie Beverly and Maze
Used to dream of being Unsigned Hype
'til I was crushed by Dave Mays, almost let my pen fall asleep on the page
Daydreamin' yesterday, dozin' off backstage
I thought I saw Eazy talking to Jam Master Jay
So I walked over, heard Jam Master say
""It's a hard knock life, then you pass away""
They say sleep is the cousin of death, so my eyes wide open
Cause a dream is kin to your last breath
Blushin' in this 40 ounce, lettin' the ink from my pen bleed
Cause Martin Luther King had a (dream)
Aaliyah had a (dream), Left Eye had a (dream)
So I reached out to Kanye and (I brought you all my dreams)
(Cause I love you, I love you, I love you)
The dream of Huey Newton that's what I'm livin' through
The dream of Eric Wright, that's what I'm givin you
Who walked through the White House without a business suit
Compton hat, jheri curl drippin on Ronald Reagan's shoes
Gave Mike Lem my demo, came here to pay my dues
Started off with Whoo Kid, then I start blazin' Clue
It was all a dream like Big said it'd be
Don't sleep on me homey, I bring nightmares to reality
Rap phenomenon, defyin' the rules of gravity
Studied all the classics, start revisin' my strategy
Cause Marshall Mathers made it, Curtis Jackson made it
Head in the clouds, wonderin' where the hell Marvin Gaye went
How do I say this? I'm livin' for my son
But I can't figure out, why I'm at my temple with this gun
Wake up to a Jesus piece like a catholic nun
The war to be a rap legend, has just begun
Blushin' in this 40 ounce, lettin' the ink from my pen bleed
Cause Martin Luther King had a (dream)
Aaliyah had a (dream), Left Eye had a (dream)
So I reached out to Kanye and (I brought you all my dreams)

With two Desert Eagles and an ounce of glue

'Cause they know I'm packin' heat under the Willie Mays jersey
Nigga, it ain't nuttin' for me to empty a clip
Or wave my guns in the air and just enter ya strip
I know about gangs, had shootouts with plenty of Crips
I sold crack and been out of town with plenty of bricks
So ain't nuttin' you can tell me, about the game
Come with beef and leave here without your brains
And I'ma drive upstate and try to bounce this 'caine
In that Shelby the same color as moutanin rain
And you know I got the South clickin'
'Cause ain't nuttin' like niggaz with gold teeth
And them down South chickens
So fuck with my D and get found wit'cha mouth missin'

Independent tycoons, tycoons, yeah
My niggaz puff trees, snort coke and chew shrooms
Bad to the bone, to the bone
And can't trust a nigga for shit 'cause Fed's on the phone
My whole crew dirty, fuckin' with amphetamines
Catch you slippin' blow your whole crew to smitharines
Now the streets knowin', knowin'
And I'ma run this shit back with my foot broke like Terrell Owens
Still blowin'
Like Mike Jones of the Swishahouse, gold knock them bitches outs
We take trips out to Houston and D.C.
For the West coast, nigga can you feel me?

If we ain't movin' the rocks, then we movin' the stocks
Cross a hustler motherfucker you'll arrive in a box

And a lil' too eager to sit in the spot

I hit the spot like a [unverified] in ballers and jeans
On some eighty-eight shit, more raw than Kane
It's not my fault she looked at me, you better talk to your dame
That's just, part of the game and you got served
Who got nerve cause Lethal hard like Tupac words
And, why y'all chucks always actin' like tough guys
You must be trippin' or you slippin' on mudslides
And in the hood you see it's different from one time
What's your bloodline, play the strip to the sunshine
And I don't even know why I'm wastin' my breath

Clear [Incomprehensible] and I'm the individual
Holdin' weight in the dope state
Tokin' the 8-8, oh, fold [Incomprehensible]
Watch our bread and our team skyrocket
Visualize I can rip beam on the cash and not 8 guys can't stop it
What'chu know about stackin' G's, you got to come fuck wit me
Puffin' on sticky green, you got to come fuck wit me
My team is just oh, so clean, you got to come fuck wit me

just-beginning-where-i-m-from,2005,game,Hip-Hop,"Sometimes I wonder
Man, how long is it gon' be for my people to come up
Man, we strugglin', it's hard sometimes
But tomorrow's better than yesterday
I was born in the slums, struggled from day one
Ray Charles vision, blinded by the light from the sun
No navigation, no sense of direction
Darker complexion made it hard to live
Dad, how you fathered your kids?
Stranded on the highway of life
Left us out to die, left us out to dry
Shh, I'm still hearin' my mother's cries, nigga
No father figures make harder niggaz
Through the years, went to war with niggaz
From what I saw in the picture
Now your son is bigger, thirteen, looks just like you
Mom said I would grow up and be just like you
From what you did to my sister, she disliked you
Sixteen, eleventh grade, look at me, just like you
Gunnin' for riches, runnin', hoppin' project fences
Street corners to Arizona, how I earn my digits
And I'm far from finished, gamin' till my coffee diminish
Why pray for the after life when mines just beginnin', huh
Only son by our mother, no brothers, only sisters by this one
Every time I kissed one, I missed one, let me explain
Eight years before The Game, everything came with pain
Watch the fate of my family slain would never see good times again
Cursed with pain by a nigga with no shame
My father bear the same name as his father
My grandfather wouldn't believe, he pulled up our family tree
I can see him rollin' over in his coffin'
I'm left with often thoughts of how could you molest your daughter
They say that's ten times worse than manslaughter
Man, you oughta be dead in a grave
But it wasn't my call, so instead you sat in a cage
High-powered, two-hundred and fifty pound, six-five coward
Woulda been dead in an hour
Heard you were scared to take a shower, scared of the yard
Your end is near, you shoulda been scared of God, motherfucker"
money-over-bitches,2005,game,Hip-Hop,"Huh, niggaz think they got the game sewed, yeah right
I'm air tight, fresh in them Air Nikes
If the Navi outside, I might be there

And when the beef cook, I'ma put the piece to your head
And if you see a white truck that mean yo' sheets is dead
Then I'm goin', goin', back, back
To the block to dump the bucket and jump in the drop
Niggaz know I'm good with the glock, they call me Chick Hearns
'Cause if the game on knot, I'm callin the shots
I'll wear a shiny suit for a minute like I'm The L.O.X.
Then get gangster with a swap meet bag and a Jordan box
And when I die, bury me with the glock and a bucket of shells
In case niggaz want drama in hell
Yeah, so when Compton niggaz
And Fillmoe niggaz get together
Shit happens mayne, real talk from ya nigga Fig'
Doin' it big and don't wanna split yo' wig

And I hover the lands
To expand, I'm from the gutter grime and the sand
No jams the flam's all busted
The dames want the bucks when they see you stuffed in
Your pockets, 'til they get them some
But testin' my pocket, only gets you none
'Cause I got a pimp mentality
The scrubs wanna eat shrimp and get my salary
They ain't knowin' I'm tight laced in my shoestrings
Hate the way I'm flowin' on the mic 'cause I do gleam
All types of baguettes and bezels

JUST BLAZE!

Gangsta gangsta, that's already evident
Nigga Witta Attitude, check check my residence
Whether I'm Crip or Blood, homey that's irrelevant
I with the D.O.C., there's nobody better than
The West coast felon when he on that lowrider bike pedallin
Somebody tell Eazy they still yellin it
I'm wit'cha homey Doc Dre on the television
While these niggas movin peanuts like a elephant
I move cars like spinnin rims
I'm in a class all by myself like the brown Eminem
Not to down Eminem, I fuck black bitches
Fuck white bitches, nigga I like bitches
Them half-and-half Alicia Keys dyke bitches
If the head right I might Air Nike bitches
Or put 'em on the track like Just Blaze
I look down on hoes and look up to Dre
Cause ain't (""No more fun and games!"")
Gangsta, gangsta! (""That's what they're yellin"")
(""It's not about a salary, it's all about reality"")
(""I ain't gotta tell you this but one mo' time.."")
(""Leroy!"") ("".. now pay attention"")
I'm like Dre, Eazy, Cube, King Tee and Ren rolled in one
Used to move birdies 'til I put a hole in one
Nigga that thought I wasn't holdin a gun
And tried to ride up on me like Afeni Shakur's only son
Dre told me he ain't doin Detox, this his only run
Mase comin back, and Hov, he done
I'm surrounded by legends, sittin at the round table
I am The Game, and still niggas tryin to play dude
I'm ruthless, I ain't talkin 'bout the label
I'll hook niggas up, and I don't mean free cable
I mean I'll hook niggas up to them IV's
The same way Dre hooked me up to Iovine
I'm from the gutter, grew up in public housing
On the same block with a shack like Yao Ming
So if a nigga ever try to Jerry Heller me
Tell Dre put up a mill, cause that's what my bail'll be
Gangsta, gangsta! (""That's what they're yellin"")
(""It's not about a salary, it's all about reality"")
(""Nigga I just came out the hole, I done did my time"")
(""Nigga what you know about time?"")
I've been rappin for one year, one month, 17 days
13 hours, 28 minutes, then I met Dre
30 minutes after I bought the new Em
That was November 18th, 3:09 PM
Around the same time, ""Wanksta"" got it's first spin
That was 32 weeks before they signed Rakim
Eight months, 13 days before I knew where Mike lived
And three years after Mason Betha turned his mic in
I started writin 22 months and 20 weeks prior
To LeBron shakin Adidas for Nikes
I'm right here, six years after Randy Moss
Caught his first touchdown for them Vikings
Just one day, seven hours, 14 minutes
21 seconds before SoundScan got printed
Two platinum records 'fore I'm classified with Biggie
And two seconds before the song finish, yeah"

Had a million dollars 'fore I was 1

Remember me? Like father, like son
Had a million dollars 'fore I was 1
'Cause my daddy hustle
We good now

Winning like Steph Curry in the chip though
Used to be the only one, now I'm the big bro (I'm here too)
Know my daddy schizo, don't mess with his kids yo
Me and my brother tight (yeah), we like the Klitschkos
I love you daddy
Ten years later, I love you too sons
I do life in the box if they ever fuck with my two sons
You're my lil' man, I remember the first day you came out
Your lil' face, your big nose, your lil' feet, your lil' hands
You turned one, come in the room wobbly, lil' stance
And every time I walked in the house he used to do this lil' dance
On the cover of the album with them Chucks on
You cried for 6 hours, your mama in here going nuts on me
She said you had enough, I said we having fun
All babies cry when they're one, my career had just begun
And so did being a daddy
Car seat in my Escalade, you want me in the Caddy
Playing Like Father, Like Son, looking in the back seat
He don't look nothing like his mama if you ask me
On the first album Busta Rhymes did the hook
Now he can do it for himself, watch him and his uncle cook
Buss
I'm glad you grew up to becoming everything you could be
That's all I wanted for you young'n, like father, like son
And in the end I'm glad you only turned out better than me
I hope you know I love you young'n, like father, like son
Your daddy told you it was coming
Coming, your day was coming, I told you
Now daddy's here just keep on running
Running, just keep on running, I tell you
I wanna thank my baby mamas Tiff and Eliska for everything
Y'all deserve the world, I wasn't worthy of no wedding ring
It ain't be one day since I met you I wasn't there for you
Wasn't husband material, but you know I really cared for you
And I know you remember that time when he was 5
All these tours taking the toll, I can see it in his eyes
So I stopped tours, stopped rapping, didn't give a fuck about
Nothing that happened after recording The Doctor's Advocate
Catching up with my son, cause ain't nothing more important
Than walking inside the Footlocker, copping them matching Jordans
Helping him with his jumper, the day he turned 9
I asked him what he want for his birthday, he said to spend some time
So we kick it, that's my best friend, I don't have to get married
He still my best man, and that's forever
Anybody can be a daddy, just bust a nut and leave
But I'm a father, and I'ma be everything he need and more
I'm glad you grew up to becoming everything you could be
That's all I wanted for you young'n, like father, like son
And in the end I'm glad you only turned out better than me
I hope you know I love you young'n, like father, like son
Your daddy told you it was coming
Coming, your day was coming, I told you
Now daddy's here just keep on running
Running, just keep on running, I tell you
Every time I get in this booth
I'm reminded ten years ago I did it for you, had this vision for you
And I know your daddy get in trouble sometimes
But I'ma stay up out this prison for you, I mean
You all my seed, lil' brother and both of your sisters
You all I need like Method and MJB
And I know I be wildin' sometimes, you told me (""Breathe daddy"") (1,1, 2,2, 3,3, 4,4)
Furthermore, I'm try'na stay outta trouble just for my sons
Even though it feel weird leaving my house without a gun
I just gotta do it, cause they might grow up and do this shit
Just cause they father do it, fuck with my kids and six Bloods
Jumping out a Buick, understand Puff choking that man for Jus
I'ma do my stuff even if I land in fucking cuffs
For every nigga out here without a kid
Have one and that's gon be the best shit you ever did
One"

I ain't gon' jump though, I'mma keep it raw gutter
Yo Prodigy, you know I need you on this one nigga
I got shit on my chest, I must confess
Last night I was the nigga that shot up your projects
Now I'm back in the hood, with rocks in the Pyrex
Tan khakis and them Nike Airs with the dyed checks
I was forced to live this life, forced to bust my chrome
My pops left me in a foster home
I felt abandoned like Quik now that Mausberg gone
So I don't hop in the SS without the Mossberg homes
I've been rappin' for a year and a half, my life is real
Put the gun in his mouth, he gon' bite the steel
Come to Compton, I got stripes for real
Before Dre, before the ice, before the deal - I was almost killed
Like 'Pac before the Death Row deal
I got shot over two pounds of weed, still ain't found them niggas
But karma come quicker for a nigga on the other side of the gun
That's somethin I gotta teach my son
I don't need your love, no no no no
I don't need your love
Need it, I don't want it, I don't need it
I don't need your love, no I don't need your love
I don't need your love
Cause, the, game, don't, change
I heard they got Bloods in New York now
Red rags in Uptown Harlem now, I need that love
Front court at the Knicks game, new chick, French name
New car, new house, and sometimes friends change
And you don't need that love, when you G's like us
And your Jesus piece is sim-u-lar to Biggie's
And your life story is sim-u-lar to 50's
First they hate you, then they love you, then they hate you again
What the fuck do it take for a gangsta to win?
No mics, no Unsigned Hype, nigga fuck The Source
Plus them awards I don't need
And them niggas breathing the same air as me, acting like they don't bleed
We don't drive the same speed, this a Continental T
That's a case of Armadale, this a continental suite
So I'mma drown in my own sorrows
Live life, fuck tomorrow, nigga cause reality is
I don't need your love, no no no no
I don't need your love
Need it, I don't want it, I don't need it
I don't need your love, no I don't need your love
I don't need your love
Cause, the, game, don't, change
I was gassed up, Murder Inc., Roc-A-Fella passed up
Sat in Daddy's House with Black Rob and Lou and asked Puff
Now The Game's set in stone, the Franck Muller's set in stones
Dre cut me a check, I'm gone
Tryin to be the king of the streets, niggas'll wet your throne
But I got nieces to feed, two coasts to please
So I roam through the city like the ghost of E
Gotta put Compton back where it's 'sposed to be
Nothing between all my niggas that's close to me
In the streets with two fellas packing toast for me
I'm 'posed to be, got all the critics watching my pivot
On my block in the Coupe reading kites from prison
I got niggas doing life in prison
All my fallen soldiers is one of the reasons we pour out liquor
So this song is for Ms. Wallace, Afeni Shakur
And all the mothers of dead sons that went out in the war
I don't need your love, no no no no
I don't need your love
Need it, I don't want it, I don't need it
I don't need your love, no I don't need your love
I don't need your love
Cause, the, game, don't, change
I don't need your love, no no no no
I don't need your love
Need it, I don't want it, I don't need it
I don't need your love, no I don't need your love

See my nigga Church, ""What Up,"" shit I left the camcorder in the truck
Running through the maternity ward, out of breath, sweating

Spread my wings, If only I could fly

They say every time somebody die a child is born
So I thank the nigga who gave his life for the birth of my son
11:32, she screaming at the top of her lungs
I'm panicking, nurse yelling for the doctor to come
All I could remember was lamaze class, breathe baby
""One (one), two (two), three (three), four (four),"" I see the head
Doc busting through the door, he between the legs
He see the head, it's my baby boy
11:46, the head out, she screaming, making crazy noise
Pain is love, my stomach folding like a La-Z-Boy
I'm feeling like Mariah Carey, all these butterfly's
Voices singing to me, sound like Teena Marie
I'm calling niggas on tour, ""Jayo tell ? I just cut the umbilical cord""
11:57, a soldier is born, and he's flesh of my flesh, young Harlem Coron
[Chorus: Busta Rhymes]
I hope you grow up to become that everything you can be
That's all I wanted for you young'n, like Father, like Son
But in the end I hope you only turn out better than me
I hope you know I love you young'n, like Father, like Son
My little man, your day is coming, coming, your day is coming, I tell you
And when it comes, just keep it running, running, just keep it running, I tell you
[Verse 3: The Game]
I wanna thank Dr. ? and Nurse Theresa, for bringing my baby boy to life
You birthed a Caesar, And my baby Mama, Aliska
For pushing out a 10-pound, 4-ounce Mini-Me, I still can't believe it
Nose, ears, eyes, chin, just like your Daddy
I die before you grow up and be just like your Daddy, or your Grandfather
Call Uncle ?, tell him I got a son and I ain't even in Harlem
I'm popping Cris with your Godfathers, Baron Davis and ""D-Mack"" Darius Rogers
Drop the top on the '71, with my face in the clouds, Lord spare my son
And watch over Aaron Wright, T'Yan and Lil' Pun
Lowriding, banging ""Ready to Die,"" track number 1
If I bust 5 times and they never see the sun
My life is a black hole, like the barrel of a gun, one
[Chorus: Busta Rhymes]
I hope you grow up to become that everything you can be
That's all I wanted for you young'n, like Father, like Son
But in the end I hope you only turn out better than me
I hope you know I love you young'n, like Father, like Son
My little man, your day is coming, coming, your day is coming, I tell you
And when it comes, just keep it running, running, just keep it running, I tell you
I hope you grow up to become that everything you can be
That's all I wanted for you young'n, like Father, like Son
But in the end I hope you only turn out better than me
I hope you know I love you young'n, like Father, like Son
My little man, your day is coming, coming, your day is coming, I tell you
And when it comes, just keep it running, running, just keep it running, I tell you"

The snakes full of venom, the wolves out and huntin'
In this concrete jungle, in this concrete jungle, woo
In this concrete jungle, in this concrete jungle, woo
I sink in my teeth cause these niggas is sweet
Predator to the prey, you should pray for the weak
Spray out Caprices, drive by with the reaper
I hang out the window like I'm an AC
Bodies turn cold after losing your pulse
Turn that dude to a ghost like the homie SP
Yeah, from the LAX with these bars I keep locked
Ain't a prison, I'm free, I can rap in my sleep
Dude on the post with rocks using shots
They come back to your ass like an offensive rebound
Funeral home on the speed dial
When God call your number
Man, trust me, there won't be no re-dial
We out here every day, they acting senile
Year of the wolf, niggas 'bout to hear me out
This beat I'mma wreck while these gorillas beat on their chest
West swing, I'm knocking their trees down
So go in your temple
These niggas is dinner from January all the way to December
Shouldn't have played with my killers

Rappers always talking, you ain't 'bout it like that
Coward out the hood to get it then I brought it right back
Blood money rider, keep the chopper right beside 'em
FMN fully loaded, that's for any nigga want it
This sound like I got the shit, but fact it don't it
Grab a cork, get to sparkle, talking like one of my opponents
Rate these haters above 'em
You talk some cash when you talk to me
I ain't got no love for you if you ain't getting guwop with me
All my niggas from day one gwho I'm gon take to the top with me
And this shotty on me, got the boy, I walk this so [?]
I was raised in the wild with them lions and tigers

I'm sippin on that 'notiq the color of Hulk man
And the blueberry smoke got a nigga twerkin
You niggaz is perkin - so you doin it big?
You roll deep but when I see you it's just you and your kids
I roll sick, my rims feel like helicopter propellers
And my pockets run deep like a Mercer teller
Haters trip when they see the whip dippin by
The paint on it change like the I-95
I'm just Clyde, without the Bonnie, I got the hollowpoint
heat for you niggaz and the po' for the mamis
Sean Gotti, I'm puttin an end to camraderie
I'm lettin off heat, 'til them eyes get watery
Some gon' ricochet, some gon' hit, y'all gon' get 'em
Fluids gon' disperse out like refreshin club serum
I'm deadly as bite venom but I'm far from a snake
I'll hit you up on your birthday while you cuttin your cake

The chains, the fuckin broads we with

And my niggaz'll put you under the street
We gangsters nigga; so you better watch what you say
'Fore I empty the whole glock in your face

Streets is tough, but ain't no hopscotch lines on the ground
Just burner shells, and police siren sounds
Niggaz know who I am in the town; it ain't a circus
But it might as well be, cause you know I'ma clown
I'm a terrain boss, I know most niggaz envious dawg
And if a nigga owe me change you better give me it dawg
If you feelin like you wanna leap, make like a frog
You niggaz lame, transparent like Wonder Woman's plane
I'm a stunna in this game, a federal figure
Blowin doj' in the hummer, 50 K on my fingers
I'm like a NASCAR winner poppin Mo' and Bill{?}

Poodles gon' be up missin or dead
I chop haters up, like an old-ass sample
Or creep through your village, like Stallone in ""Rambo""
I'm like piranhas on red meat, I'm on you niggaz
You afros? Then I guess I got to comb you niggaz
So break bread, when you see me dawg hit the flo'
I'm like a nigga off the X, unpredicta-ble

Uh huh
Comin' up I was confused, my mama kissin' a girl
Confusin' occurs, comin' up in the cold world
Daddy ain't around, probably out committin' felonies
My favorite rapper used to sing ch-check out my melody
I wanna live good, so shit I sell dope
Four-four fingering, one of them gold ropes
Nanna told me if I pass I'll get a sheep skin coat
If I can move a few packs I'd get the hat, now that'll be dope
Tossed and turn in my sleep that night
Woke up the next mornin' niggas done stole my bike
Different day, same shit, ain't nothin' good in the hood
I'd run away from this bitch and never come back if I could
Hate it or love, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homie until my heart stops
Go ahead, envy me, I'm rap's MVP

First mixtape song, I inherited beef fo' ya
Gritted my teeth fo' ya, G-G-G'd fo ya (G-Unit)
Put Compton on my back when you was in need of soldiers
At my last show, I threw away my NWA gold
And had the whole crowd yellin' free Yayo
So niggas better get up outta mine
Before I creep and turn ya projects into Columbine
And I'm rap's MVP
Don't make me remind y'all what happened in D.C.
This nigga ain't Gotti, he pretend
Mad at us, cause Ashanti's got a new boyfriend
And it seems your little rat turned out to be a mouse
This beef shit is for the birds and the birds fly south
Even Young Buck can vouch, when the doubts was out
Who gave the West Coast mouth to mouth

From the beginnin' to the end
Losers lose, winners win
This is real, we ain't got to pretend
The cold world that we in
Is full of pressure and pain
I thought it would change
Its stayin' the same
How many hidden bowls is with'cha ya
When you had that little TV you had to hit on to get a picture
I'm walkin' with the snub, cause niggaz do a lotta slick talkin' in the club
Till they coughin' on the rug, ain't never had much but a walkman and a bud
My role model is gone, snortin' up his drug, bad enough they want me to choke
My boy just got poked in the throat, now its a R.I.P. shirt in my coat
Now I'm speedin' reminiscin', holdin' my weed hit never listen
If I see him then I'ma lift'em and maybe that'll even the score
And if not, then it'll be me on the floor
Hate it or love, the underdog's ontop

Go ahead, envy me, I'm rap's MVP

Hate it or love, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homie until my heart stops
Go ahead, envy me, I'm rap's MVP
And I ain't goin' no where so you can get to know me
I started out at fifteen, scared as hell
I took thirty off a pack and I made them sell
As a youth, man I used to hustle for loot
With that little deuce deuce and my triple fat goose
Sippin' easy Jesus rockin' the leases
My mama whipped me when she found my pieces
I look back on life and think God I bless
We the best on the planet so forget the rest
You know I'm still nice with my cook game
Look man, its a hood thing that's why I'm loved in Brooklyn
I handle mine just like a real nigga should
If I do some time, homie I'm still all good
Let me show what a thug bout born to die
I took the bullets outta 50, put 'em in my four five
And I ain't even got my feet wet yet
A seven figure nigga who ain't seen a royalty check
Hate it or love, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homie until my heart stops
Go ahead, envy me, I'm rap's MVP
And I ain't goin' no where so you can get to know me

Yo, yo, now ain't no tellin' what the Game'll do, listen dawg
I blow the guts out the dutch and do the same to you
And just to get shit crackin', I drop the toaster
Grab the Louis, go Sammy Sosa
And you ain't gotta know me to know that
I hop out a new pink Rolls
With the fifty-two, Pete Rose throwback
Haze in my eyes, listen to Bobby Womack
On the same corner where Eazy-E sold Coke at
And dawg, I'ma test your education
What do I mean when I say I move more birds than migration?
I'm the nigga that'll smoke the purple, get high as a kite
Down half the Goose then choke your workers
Don't make me put two in your shirt, dawg, I put in the work
Then move bags like Doony & Bert
And stuff work in the GMC 'cause on my block
I'm the King of Rock like Run-DMC, nigga
I'm a mobster, with a mac-11 chopper
That'll pop ya and put one through ya motherfuckin' collar
I'm a mobster, Robin Hood's like Kevin Costner
If ya fuck with my dollars, I'll make you swallow my daughters
I'm a mobster, I keep a bitch by my waist
Just in case I gotta draw down to get this big face
I'm a mobster, I'm a mobster
I got a lot to say
Dawg, I gotta get paid that's why I rock the lle'
And chop the lle' to push bricks through your block a day
I'll bring terror to your squad and make you rock away
Don't depend on tomorrow, you can get shot today
I'll spit acid on your turf and watch your block decay
Dawg, I spit on your grave and fertilize you too
I hit 'em hard with 16 bars, flames and fumes
Somebody needs to push your infant rap back in the womb
Go 'head and keep talkin' that shit and get your life consumed
I put a hole in your chest, dawg, the size of the moon
Yeah, you musta been talkin' how'd you get out that soon?
I got a chop that'll touch yo' head like Vidal Sassoon

I'm a mobster, I keep a bitch by my waist
Just in case I gotta draw down to get this big face
I'm a mobster, I'm a mobster
It don't matter what season, don't matter not a day
I move traffic through the city, plus, I keep the right of way
I'm on point like Bibby, I'm the leader of the team, mayne
Got the whole city amped just like a Lakers versus Kings game
Everybody's fired up, I drop major packages
I'm never doin' bids because my game is so immaculate
The bitch try to snitch, ""I can't deny it"" like Fabolous
Before the evidence gatherin', someone's in an ambulance
Now, that'll learn you to keep your big mouth shut
Those with big mouths, I got the perfect size nuts
Yeah, I do my dirt but I wash my hands thoroughly
Handle my business first so I can celebrate early
It's business before pleasure, my business brings me pleasure
It feels good to be able to shine in any type of weather
That's why I do what I gotta do so my money's lookin' tight
Whether I'm jukin' on the block or have bitches hookin' lights y'know?
I'm a mobster, with a mac-11 chopper
That'll pop ya and put one through ya motherfuckin' collar
I'm a mobster, Robin Hood's like Kevin Costner

I love New York but gangbanging that's L.A. shit
And I'm proud of it
Spit it through the wire so the crowd love it
Haters you know who you are you can turn it down fuck it
I can shoot a video to it and spend half the budget
I'm gangsta, let the .40 cal blow in public
More hatred inside my soul than Pac had for Delores Tucker
Every time one of my niggas get shot the more I suffer
Cause we trapped inside a world where your forced to die for your colors
I seen it all through the Range tints
Got niggas doing life in the state pen
So I dread like Jamaicans
If I die for one of my statements
Than break up the streets of Compton and spill my blood in the pavement

And outta all the newcomers out, my flow's the illest
You a close second nigga,
A banana to a guerilla
Put us in the same cage and I'ma have to peel 'em
The best of both worlds
Rapping and drug dealing
Run and tell the chief I came to burn down the village
The head honcho, staring out the third story window
Of my Beverly Hills condo
With two long ass heats
I call 'em Shaq and Alonzo
You niggas want me outta L.A.
Yeah I know
[Hook]
Believe me niggas keep sayin' they gon' heat me up
Talking that shit like they gon' lay me down
And when I come through strapped to see what's up
Niggas really don't want no parts of me pal
Niggas keep sayin' they gon' heat me up
Talking that shit like they gon' lay me down
And when I come through strapped to see what's up
Niggas really don't know parts of me pal"

I told Dre to put out Detox, or I'ma do it
This is that nigga, The Chronic mixed with embalming fluid
Bring your chin here blood, so I can put this lama to it
Disrespectful nigga, see this window? I see ya mama through it
Do it for the coast, so we can toast to it
Who showed you all the Pirus? The SA's and how the Los do it?

Now, everybody wanna know the truth about a nigga named Game
I come from the hub and every ghetto ain't the same
A lot of people already know exactly where it's at
'Cause it's the home of the jackers and the crack, Compton
Yeah, that's the name of my hometown
I'm goin' down in the town where my name is all around
And niggaz just be hatin' and shit, that's a pity
But I ain't doin' nuttin' but claimin' my city
See my lyrics are double or nothin' provin' to suckers I can throw 'em
Pass the natural ten to four and six-eight before I go
Not really into freestylin' or tryin' to promote violence
But they gotta know about the five-five-fo', so
And that's how I'm livin', I do as I please B
A young gangsta put in work on these Cali streets
And everybody knows that you gotta be stompin'
If you're born and raised in Compton
Born and raised, born and raised
Born and raised, born and raised
Born and raised in Compton
Born and raised, born and raised
Born and raised, born and raised
Born and raised in Compton
Now, Compton is a place, where all my niggaz chill, dog
'Til I found out the streets get real dog
'Bout a year ago, somebody musta wanted me to die
'Cause they kicked in the door and gave the young kid five
They musta thought that I was gon' play the bitch role
'Cause I lived through fo' five six holes
But I ain't goin' out like no fagot-ass clown
They found, they couldn't keep a gangsta nigga down
So, here's the burner in your face, motherfucker, silly sucker
Ass clucker now you're duckin' cause you can't stop
A Y.G. gangsta 'cause I'm true to my game
You're lame, and thangs ain't gon' never be the same
'Cause a nigga like the Game is takin' over
I really don't think I should have to explain
Oh yeah, I'm a dog but my name ain't Rover
And I'm the kinda nigga that's feelin' no pain
Sometimes I have to wear a bulletproof vest
Because I got the CPT style written across my chest
A gangsta motherfucker never ceasin' to impress
My name is Young Game, so you can fuck, the rest
I'm comin' like this and I'm comin' directly
'Cause niggaz gettin' all stirred up, I'm doin' damage quite effectively
Rhymin' is a battle zone and niggaz can't win
'Cause I'm a gangsta from the C O M P T O N"

change,2005,beanie-sigel,Hip-Hop,"They say change gone come
But its a long time comin'
My legs tired
Hundred million miles runnin'
On life's treadmill
Runnin' in place
But still I run wit the race
I think back on my wonder years
Food stamps shorts of wonder bread
My mom dukes
Young, wild, loose learned a less
I got my truths from the older heads
U went 2 church n took a different route
U got ya truths from out the bishop mouth
I drunk the juice that turn dish about
Them double deuces turned my system out
And them zanies and the weed too
Fuck it I'm still here
Though its hard in the ghetto
Don't you let go
Cause a change gone come
Said a change gone come
I know your tired of the waitin'
Hold ya patients
Cause a change gone come
Yeah I know it is
What it like
The big houses
The cars
The dog
Pickett fence
And you his wife
But depict this life
You know them FEDS
Got them pictures right
I know ya stressed baby girl
Feel what you going through
Cause if they kick in that door
You know you going too
Cause every thing in ya name
From the phone bill
To the deed on the house
I gotta find a way to ease out
But you cant you feel trapped
You think back
Was it really worth it
This lifestyle could you really afford it
You then lost 4 lives
Yours and the 3 you aborted

This is my lifestyle for real.
If you could look at me now
Now its big businesses,
You see them big Bentley skids
You see them Bee's on those shiny ass
Rims of his,
You can't find him in the woods,
With his kids with his
Mob cookin' breakfast with no S.W.A.T.
A good day this is.
You could bullshit with rap if you want,
I pull the bullshit to the back
And put rap in front.
Now I'm State Prop flickin' it
State Prop stitchin' it.
I'm paper soldier y'all,
Your boy gettin' rich
I see a kids hair knotty now..
They nose snotty now
So what I do,

I make 'em smile a day
If only for a while a day
I give them dollarday
That's my ghetto holliday
I must say for myself
I'm feelin proud today,
My life is shaped
Like I run about a mile a day
I dedicate this to the one's that
Counted me out
And looked at me down
Just look at me now.
I know y'all see me
Look at me now man

oh-daddy,2005,beanie-sigel,Hip-Hop,"[Chorus: x2]
Oh daddy
You know you make me cry
How can you love me?
I can't understand why
[Beanie Sigel]
That's what they yellin' when they grab me
Eyes are swellin', cryin', tryin' to stab me
Once they realize they can't have me
When I leave 'em try to let 'em down easy like
I snatch your heart so easy like Valentine
Can't get caught up in that loop again
Never letting Cupid in
Boo you buggin' ain't no time to be lovin'
Man the grip on my pistol only thing I be huggin'
It's mack daddy not your daddy mack
Bitch you got it criss-crossed (scrap)
I ain't havin' that
I can't have your back
Look how you act when I had your back
Picture me havin' that back to back
I pimp proper like shrimp-lobster
Check out my pimp-posture
Even my limp proper, mama
I can't help what's runnin' down your face
I moved your ass into that furnished place
Like you earned that space
[Chorus]
[Beanie Sigel]
God damn baby you had me
All the twirlies in the caddy used to take it back gladly
We was tighter than Tommy Buns and Keesha
You cleaned my guns, count my ones, bagged the reefer
Shit I thought you was the one, you was my bitch
The one that never snitched
Taught you how to bust a fifth, shit
I taught you how to push a whip
Taught you how to suck a dick
Taught you how to fluff a brick
But you got more drama than a be, mama
Got me goin through the motions like C. Thomas
With the bullshit, he say she say
The bitch is mad cause my jams kick like Eastbay
Mad cause they mans got they kicks on replay
How you drop from celebrity status
Pushin' Bent to niggas in celebrity wagons
In them sucker type Jags
Now you fuckin' type mad
[Chorus]
[Young Chris]
Oh mommy its so sad
We had it together
You had it whenever
That's yo bad
You fucked up
It wasn't meant to be
You lucked up
Told me at the end don't trust her
See that's when all the bullshit started
That's what three me in reverse, counter-clockwise
In my mind I swore that we would work
But I guess that I was wrong
Ran into a dead end
Unfaithful bitch
You fucked the nigga I was blazin' with
Fugazied shit
It wasn't him it was the paper shit
Nowadays its all about the latest shit
That or they favorite...car
Or get paper from ball
Unless your label all that
And you labeled as stars
Makin' the millions
Got them bitches willin' to do
Whatever it takes
Takin' it off or willin' to screw
Whoever I bring
Guess it's a celebrity thing
But I was never ashamed
I was blessed with the game

Somethin' goin' on, I feel funny
Can't tell me nuttin' different, my nose twitchin'
Intuition settin' in like steel vision
I still close my eyes, I still see visions
Still hear that voice in tha back of my mind
So what I do? I still take heathe, I still listen
I still paint that perfect picture
I still shine bright like a prism
My words still skippin' through air, I know you can't, don't, won't get it
You niggas chose to ride that shit, 'sault wit it?
I'm still afloat, I ain't tha captain of tha yacht
But I'm on a boat, I ain't actin' what I'm not, knowin' that I don't
You niggas actin' like you will
But I know you won't, you won't

Ya handshake ain't matchin' ya smile, you niggas foul
I can feel it in the air
I can feel it in the air
I can feel it in the air
I can hear it in your voice
I can feel it in the air
I sit alone in my four cornered room starin' at hammers
Ready to go bananas
Two vests on me, two techs, extra clips on me
I know my mind ain't playin' tricks on me
I ain't skitz, hommie, ain't nobody drop a mick on me
It's like they tryna plot a set on me
I hear this voice in tha back of my mind
Like mack tighten up ya circle before they hurt you
Read they body language
85 percent communication non-verbal
85 percent swear they know you, 10 percent you know they stories
Man, tha other 5 time to show you, just know you
Then pull they strings, you tha puppet master
Fuck them other bastards, man, watch who you puffin' after
Play ya cards, go against all odds
Shoot for tha moon, if you miss you still amongst those stars
I can feel it in the air
I can feel it in the air
I can feel it in the air
I can hear it in your voice
I can feel it in the air
Can you feel it, can you feel it floatin'?
Foul picture quotin', scriptures from Revelation
Just talk shit an' got tha devil waitin'
Body get stiff, so levitate
Why do I speak blasphemy?
Knowin' one day that He'll ask for me
Ask for my sins, no one to feel His wrath for me
I go through it, so you wouldn't do it after me
As for me, I'm still circlin' tha block before I'm parkin'
Not bitchin', I'm just still cautious
Same black parka, same Uzi
Extra clips, still clappin' wit that same larkin'
Damn, I feel it in tha air, you not sincere
Nigga it ain't an us, or we, or I'ma thing
It's a good bad karma thing, this a song man
I'ma say, I swear I feel somethin' honestly
I can feel it in the air
I can feel it in the air
I can feel it in the air
I can hear it in your voice
I can feel it in the air
I can feel it in the air
I can feel it in the air
I can hear it in your voice
I can feel it in the air
I can feel it in the air"

But the pain on my heart weighs heavy it hurt
Hope you see my good intentions for whatever its worth
No self convictions when I mention my intentions in verse
Like a preacher or a deacon when he speakin' in church
Know its a lesson that I'm teachin' if you seekin' my verse
Like the shocker the hour be a grievous thing
Like the droppin' of them towers man its plain to see
That them cowards cant sing a song that'll lead us in?
They'd rather march and hold hands like M-L-K
The nigga in me like Malcolm little said 'all means necessary'
So by all means I'm armed and my weapons ready
I got my lessons ready
Hopin' I learned em before I'm laid to rest and buried
Have mercy on me.
Please have mercy on me
Please have mercy on me
Pressure bust pipes
Pressure can also make a diamond
Pressure can bust a man wrestlin' wit his conscience
His self accusin' spirit of his past
(but our lord knows mercy is greater than his wrath)
So in that, I not only pray for me, I pray for he. my dead brother Robert
Help him wit his problems
And the bumps and grinds
And the evil things and thoughts that run through his mind
Take a hand on my sister j blige
As I listen to her life go down watchin her life spin round
On them records
Every track she sing in prayer
Give her no drama let her rainy days be clear
Receivin' signs from Osama that the days is near
When babies is baby mommas man them days is here
It means that them days is now
I pray that the lord have mercy when my day come round
Please have mercy on me
Please have mercy on me

I need your mercy (Have mercy on me)
Have mercy on my soul(for my soul)
On my soul (for my soul)

Goin' through its that. in my grandmothers kitchen
Head in his lap, grandmom bitchin'
Pocket full of scrap, plus scratchin and itchin'
Back when they sip broma smoked cheeba

This one is for my real mug mixers
Who get screwed up, my thick juice sippers
Shout out, to my man lil flip
Big mo, project pat and the whole 3-6

I asked him what it was he said bun get ya weight up
This is lean, them white folks call it pearl methosine
Shit but we gonna probably drink dog cause that's what we be doin' to it

He said man that's the ounces of cough syrup that you sippin' on
So shit I poured it I sipped it, then I sipped some mo
I fired up a green monster, and I hit that house
Started relaxin', shit and to my surprise
I was noddin' out lookin' at the back of my eyes
They tried to wake me up but shit I just kept yawnin'
I fell out of my chair and woke up there the next mornin'
God bless my nigga, cause its then I been spawned
On my white muddy go but cant taste a seed at all

Smokes on pisurp

Get it by the 8, by the pint

Whatever you can stand, floats ur boat

Yes I fucks wit you if you smoke on green

Yea whatever, click or teen

When I'm sippin' that purple rain
(don't blow my high
Trust me you don't know my life)
Nigga don't blow my high, don't blow my high
When I'm tippin' that purple rain
I know it makes em crazy, it keeps me lazy
Dedicated to real syrup sippers

one-shot-deal,2005,beanie-sigel,Hip-Hop,"One shot deal, one shot one kill
Hit you with the one shot skill
Bullets lift you up like you poppin' on the wheel
Feel I can't die when I'm poppin' on the pill
So real that it feel, keep Cochran on my heels
Who rock the black and back out
Now the MAC back out, just bout to blackout
Got the ROC on my back, SP on my chain
Shooters on the block slinging P last name
Outta hot pink things like Camron Range
The cocaine cowboy at work
I put ya niggas in the dirt for one like Dirt
Concealed hammer won't jam or won't chirp
Catch you on my second merk
Fresh outta jail, ice grill gat to smirk
Bitches on the waste can't serve 'em
ROC without Jay won't work?
Shit like we ain't here
Actin' like SP ain't here
How y'all niggas can't see that clear? Clear?
Yeah, slow all the way down young scrapper
Pump ya brakes real fast, before ya crash
Crack ya head on the dash
I put ya body in a cast, keep my shotty on blast
Hard heads don't get the picture until they see the flash
You ain't ballin', you pump faking
Till you found in ya trunk naked
Four pound to ya crown like, ""Where the paper?""
B. Sig, cold crook, I trap paper like notebook
When the hot water disappear like when coke cook
Then resurface, its Sig. Berk-owitz, bitch I'm sick
Leave that ass like Dama
Sig. heat that ass like sauna
Stretch ya body out like recliner
Stretch my middle finger to your honor
like, ""Fuck the world"", that's my persona, love drama
Drop a building like Osama, you vagina
I know you wish you never met me like Carl Thomas
Try to forget me like all silence
Fuckin' with a vet be, all problems
I'm not about the threats B, I'm all promise
Before ""The Truth"", position in the booth
As a young scrap, I was vicious as a youth
Kept a gat moving pigeons in the Coupe
You was strapped, then positioned on the stoop
Stay strapped, put my pistol on shoot
Mac take ya ""Juice"" like Bishop on the roof
I had ya pissing in ya trunk like a roof
Bullets hit ya chest like a blunt rolled loose
I'm that corn liquor nigga, 100 proof
I bring the storm, all you niggas lace ya boots
Better yet, pull out ya strings, make a noose
Hang yaself, here's a deuce deuce, bang yaself like Cheddar Bob
I'm in the hood like S-T-tall cat-Crooked Letter-I
S-P-C-O, nigga yes I
Yes I
Matta fact
Yeah, Yeah
Bring it back
Bring it back, me, Doc, America's blunted
Not from there, but I'm Philly Most Wanted
Drop and roll, when my biscuit boil
Talk is greasy, tongue with Crisco oil
Streets is mine, check my flow online
At ww.cutanigga.com
Bricks, two on the hip, reach for the sky
You and ya Burberry suit is buried alive
On top of the Empire, dare me to dive
Wee there I go, no parachute
Jackass like Knoxville, hot as Cancun
Chest hair is baboon, Redman rip the show
I be the raw in ya bitches nose
She be goin' to the bathroom, sniffing blow
Like, ""Oh Docta shit, my man a joke""
I know, I be strapped with a double 4-4
And a Slim Jim to open ya Cadillac door
In the Bricks you hear them guns
Rat-a-tat-bo!m
Any nigga get X'ed out like Tic-Tac-Toe
Any bitch that know, Redman goin' the distance
We ain't tryin' to get fucked for instance
When you bust baby, goin' light the incense
Pass me the rag, hop back in the Jag
I stole out the showroom with the price tag
I wrote this rhyme off 25 blunt drags
Hear that sound (whoosh), leave a block hunchback
Killa House, understand prick

Bare witness to the greatest, can't beat us, join us
Keep heaters on us, wit red lasers
Now fair warning, sure shots won't graze ya
We hug corners, play blocks like Gators
With bundles on us, serve tre's like waiters
It's the life we chose to hustle
Can't stop it, can't knock it
Half the profit get flown out Vegas
Me and my niggaz try an' break tables
Stack chips like Connect Four
While you prick's try and whip try and stretch more
Charge less for, that ain't the program
Get ya lessons from the snow man
Like Pillsbury I get the doe man
I'll off ya head for a slice of bread
I keep my word and I'm true to my peeps
Give me a bird and my crew gon' eat
I'm over the stove like +Cuban Links+
Breakin' down +Cash Money+ like +Baby+ do
You niggaz soft like baby food
'Round the world niggaz pay me dues
While you niggaz sing the same old song like Sadies do
Grown man nigga, baby who?
I'll send you shots from the baby zoo
Old game like Grady fool
Propane flow flame you dudes
No name's don't claim ya shoes
Once again its on nigga, Sigel hard like corn liqour
I'll take you out this world like you was born nigga
Butt naked covered in blood, gaspin' for air
Clingin' for dear life, nigga you dead right

Since you was a baby coward
We been sprinklin' the world with baby powder
+So Fresh and So Clean+
Been an outcast since I was a teen
But I outlast 'cause I outblast anybody you bring
Young, you got it the prophet I told ya'll niggaz
Then I showed ya'll niggaz, you +Can't Knock It+
Don't get carried away, you a mute nigga (mute nigga)
Where was you nigga? I was doin' this here like Mary J.
Like +Every Day+, and was true nigga

They can't question what we do Jigga.

Nightmare ??? nigga
You scared 'cause I grew with Jigga
He said ""Sig' you that nigga,"" couldn't see his vision
But then he drew the picture, like a compository sketch
Yeah Sig' stay honest I'll deposit you a check
There's a secret society, all we ask is trust
No G money shit all we gots is us
True indeed, yes, more better, yes
More cheddar, S.P. chain, jeans and sweaters
Movies, cartoons, labels, etcetera
Fill in the blanks and drop blocks like tetris or

Once again it's on, fuck it we ain't through wit niggaz
Twin towers here to ruin niggaz
You couldn't break up the towers with Tomjanovich
Or Osama bombin' shit
We slay niggaz wit K's, we the drama men
Get it right young scrap don't even try it boy (boy)
You rather slide down the razor blade slidin' board
I'm a live wire, hoolahoop barb wire
Run through hell with gasoline draws on
You can't mute me put the pause on
My guns shoot like fast-foward's on
And dress cute when the war's off
What you doin' dawg, you playin' wit it
You make your bed right you layin' in it
You keep your ?share? tight you stayin' in it
You bringin' niggaz where your kids sleep
I sing to niggaz while the kids sleep
Rock-a-bye muthafucka.

The reason why we lead the pack, this is a marathon
You start off fast then you weezin' in the back
So even if I slack, I got enough lee-way
To put out The Reason by the Mac, Philadelphia Freeway
And I'm back, without leavin' I'm here, but you can't see him
I gave you the Blueprint but you can't be him
So no matter what you been told or the records you sold
Deep inside you know that it's only one Hove

With an attitude, like, and ya don't stop
Aficionado, so fashionable
Wit a confident swagger, international
Game so tight the girls had to go
And you don't stop!
[Beanie Sigel]
Sicker than your average
Money too long, can't stash it
In the closet or the mattress
Paper, stretch like elastic
Checks from advances, the bank can't cash it
So the price for that, never ask it
Just sign my name or pop plastic
Hating ass cops want to harass 'em
Searching for a glock in the pocket of his fashion
Bitches wit SP stitches on they asses
And they left breast (Yes!)
Let's get dressed and toast to the occasion
Cops couldn't page 'em, flow so amazing, hot like Cajun
You fucking wit the champ
Pop corks on champ' like I just took the chip
Nigga took the stand when he could of took the 5th
Yeah eat a dick wit AID's on the tip, keep my name off ya lips
Not guilty!
[Chorus]
[Beanie Sigel]
I said I'm sicker than your average
Keep three shooters like the Mavericks
Short to the point like Nash is, fucking wit a savage
Niggas press they luck, get bucked like ashes
Three piece suits, linen fabrics
Three quarter croc, sharper than a pastor be
Sig bring the light to the masses
Of these rap bastards, who gives street passes
One shooting can lead to three caskets
Jump suits, state boots, at least three stabbings
You softer than a Reebok Classic
Folding under pressure when confronted by them badges
I was taught stay low and keep blasting
Po only know questions that was answered
Keep a number on the high price lawyer
It's five ways now days, everybody saw ya
[Chorus]
[Snoop Dogg (Beanie Sigel)]
Now let's toast to the man, that when he get out
That he gon do them thangs that he rap about
A true playa Pha-real (Pharrell)
(Haters stay out my face)
(And know that thing still by my waist)
[Beanie Sigel]
Once again I'm sicker then 'em all
Niggas see see's, start shitting in they drawers
When I kick in the door, stop the blood clot crying
Wipe the piss off the floor
The ape is back, my gate is cracked
My jumpsuit and my cuffs is off
Yeah I'm back on them bricks
Raise your cups and raise your glass
And let's toast to the boy be
Mack, yeah I'm back in the mix!

Fresh out the federal cases I got several
About four or five just had to settle two
They said I try to show a nigga what the metal do
But didn't succeed the nigga still breath
Attempt please I would of hit him in his peas
With the Mac with the beam that got back in the breeze
Only clap from the neck up I'd let the heck-lar plug 'em
I don't think they made Kevlar scullys fuck it
I should of let the are touch him cuffed him
To the bumper drug him two city blocks
The juice in me and the henny shot
Four perks' and a ?hitter ock?

Mask on like I'm Jason
Shoot up shit like Larry Davis
You play the pulpit like Pastor Mason
Turn cheek like Martin Luther

Got my eyes on my mark in the dark shootin
Beam illuminate the target movin
Get your organs ruined
Move out like SWAT move in
Got them niggaz on the back-block rootin
For the bad guy..
Playground legend like Sadait(?)
P. Kirkland...My MP state workin
Shootin-arm stay jerkin

Can't answer cause the feds lurkin
Its like we catchin cancer on purpose
Back to back chain smoking, nicotine feinin
Conversation with demons when I'm dreamin
Manic-depressive
Like the man upstairs tryin to pass me a lesson
But I can't catch it
The game under break the pressure

We ride hard til our numbers get called

Got me back to back buckin my squares
But I ain't bitchin I ain't scared
I ain't budgin, in fact the thrill alone turns me on
Got me smiling, laughin...Clutchin
My toast and confrontin mother fuckers
Cock-a-roaches will not catch me laughin
Skinny and slim fram why'all get it the same
Cool niggaz that'll spin out they waves
Grimey niggaz that'll spin to they graves
Justifyin my foul ways
I got kids to raise
But motherfuckers rather see me sprayed
Than to see me pair (fucker)
Or see me on the front page like Sig
Or stay rolled DC with B. Sig
You bitch niggaz stay PC when why'all see me
Until the day that they
Fit me in the grave and the city wreak of me
We got the city under siege

Poverty is a movie starrin me
Ride with no play the passenger seat
So why'all can see how my life so real
So why'all can see how my life so ill

Tales of a hustler that's me in the flesh
Got a Jag and a Caddy sellin dimes of the step
Niggaz want to take my block I had to earn my respect
So I put his cerebellum on his grandma's steps
You know Oschino he'll probly kill
Got the soul of Huey Newton nigga Bobby Seale
Nigga prolly take the stand he'll prolly squeal
But I got four lawyers I ain't takin the deal (Nigga)
We could strap without scrap or put the semi in it
Gun fully loaded like the Chrysler with the hemmy in it
I keep it ghetto like a 40 with the Henny in it
Went to school broke loafers on no pennies in it
Stood the coldest winter with the bummiest coat
Need food need shoes sold dummies of soap
Got tired of bein broke man life was a bitch
They bring you flowers when you head but no soup while you sick
So I switched my whole picture get involved with the bricks
Not the ones made of semen but the ones who sniffs
Tales of hustler, niggaz come for your jugular
If you sell one bag to they mother fuckin customers

Got every boulevard every street every ave
Got sneakers got clothes nigga you do the math

Wanted just one chance to tell her

i-can-t-go-on-this-way,2005,beanie-sigel,Hip-Hop,"Honor, trust, respect
Devotion, friendship, loyalty
Karma, team, us, ROC
Solid, the evils, damn
With no union, and no benefits no dental plans
I can't eat off no hundred grand
I got cavities dat need fillin'
You can't feed a nigga Peanut Chews
Now put ya feet up in a nigga' shoes
A lack of green'll give a nigga blues
A sip of purple make a nigga rue
Make a drunk person speak a sober tune (I can't go on this way)
Fuck dat, I can't do it man
We make these tips off this gift that we cursed wit
But then my mind drift, am I defeatin' the purpose?
'Cause you feel like shit when you miss your son's first shit
But who gon' pay the bills? Supply the meals? No surplus
My baby mama give me drama on the daily
Like she making it barely and my kids is eating rarely (I can't go on this way)
I'm stressed out goin' through it I can't do it
If you put puppies in the oven, do that make 'em biscuits?
Put hungry dogs in the kitchen, will they eat the kittens?
Do you hear me, are you listening? It's a big difference
Do you catch the lines or the hooks or are you still fishin'?
These a couple questions that I need to be answered
Like is these Backwoods and weed givin' me cancer (I can't go on this way)
I'm stressed out goin' through it I can't do it
My momma say I got a nerve stress
Got her waking up in cold sweats
I'm hard-headed and iron
What make it worse my lil brother behind me
Blood pressure running like Harriet
She can't handle it
I got her screaming Lord Jesus like Mahalia
Son I'm tellin' ya please don't let me bury ya (I can't go on this way)
I'm stressed man, I'm goin' through it
I was taught trust in the Lord but still tie up your camel
Use your tongue as your sword and your books as your ammo
But when them bullets start flying and you got pussies around you
And who you rely on, got them niggas surround you? Shit
And make me feel like young Tinner, from the start I was finished
How a nigga start wit a finish and begin wit a endin' (I can't go on this way)
I'm stressed out, I can't take it no more
I'm moving ass backwards with no forward progress
Feel asthmatic like treadmill keep jogging
Stagnant, running in place is tragic
My heart in the faith I don't practice
I still pray Allah, forgive me for my actions
'Cause I spit gangsta, think Muslim, and act Kaffir (I can't go on this way)
I gotta still feel feed my youngin's, so keep huggin
I can't wait until the rain turn to sunshine
'Cause I hate to spend my life, my life, my life, my life
Stuck in one time, Free patrol the block
Get avoided by the government avoid the spot
Can't wait 'til rain turn to sunshine
'Cause I hate to spend my life, my life, my life, my life
Stuck in the box (I can't go on this way)
Straight from the ghetto
The ghetto I'm from the youngest be the ghettoest ones
Tryna make just as much as we could
Tryna make it but they gon make it hard as much as they could
That's why, that's why I hate 'em man
Them crackers ain't nothing without paper
They look at us it's nothing and uh (I can't go on this way)
Came too far and I ain't going backwardds for nothing
I ain't being distracted by nothing
Midget-size to Dikembe, I ain't backed up from nothing
Ma I'm still stressing
It ain't the kid it's the bills stressing, she hold it down on her own
She hold me down at the crib, hold me down while I'm gone
She held me down as a kid, hold me down while I'm grown (I can't go on this way)
I choose not, refuse not, down on my own
Now off the streets, runnin' wit the hottest label in the industry
The hottest label got a nigga lot of enemies
So now when I go in baseline
A nice-size ratchet to throw in wasteline
I gotta make mine
My bills ain't getting paid in, kids ain't situated (I can't go on this way)
Y'all better make a decision before us
'Cause the way that we living ain't all good
Ran away wit them hating ass niggas don't like us
Despite them, we gon' do it regardless
But all this commotion they causing, I ain't with it
(We ain't with it)
They can get it all it take is a call 'em

Someday got to forget it though
Consequences for my sentence, got to forgive us though"
beanie-mack-bitch,2001,beanie-sigel,Hip-Hop,"You know my name, bitch
Uh yeah, hold up
The streets gave me heat, and the Eagle was the thing that they gave me
It's the rap guerilla that still clap, fucker
Yeah, guess who's back?
Mack, bitch, I move blocks and pounds
I move out with small blocks from towns
Move out with small glocks and pounds (uh-huh)
And I take everything to the table bag and rock it down
Fuck who watchin' now, the neighbors, they in pocket now
Fuck you haters cop some pocket now
When it come to coke you cant outwit me, mine cheap
Bout to take over the city of Philly like John Street
Nigga ask all y'all fiends, they call me Chef Boyar-Beans
Beanie Crocker, cook coke proper
Right amount of flour siffin' it up
Coke spots runnin' by the hour shiftin' it up
Graveyard shifts, move packs in bundles
Braveheart kids, use gats don't rumble
Gorilla niggas goin' ape in this concrete jungle
Banana clips'll make them monkeys humble
[Chorus]
Beanie! Sigel was the name that they gave me
Beanie! Sigel was the name that they gave me
Beanie, Beanie Sigel was the name that they gave me
Beanie! Yeah, but guess who back
It's Mack, bitch uh-huh, back in the mix or the scuffle
I'm in the hood with them chips like Ruffles
Boxman, Frito Lay, for that free dough boxin'
You will lay, nigga I'm not playin'
Listen, whether I make cash or take cash
I'm in the hood eatin' with my dog like when we break-fast
B's on the hood and the wheel and the brake pad
Shit when I skate past, bitches shake ass
I sit four-thirty deep in wheels
You bout, four-thirty cheap in wheels, small Benz
Look at your small rims, small wheel, small grill
Big Beans, sittin' in Bentley my heart peels
Zero to sixty so quickly how you want it? You can have it
Drop top, stick shift, automatic
Back wheels still smokin'
64 still rolling, 3 wheel motion, it's ferocious
[Chorus]
Mack, hey yo
On the low doe (shh!) the whole city is mine
I'm trying to flood the whole city with dimes (yeah)
I'm in the kitchen yeah, with that vision wear
Get them digits clear you can come and get them pigeons here
Niggas talk about the crack game slowed up, bullshit
You switch to hustle when the rap game showed up (uh-huh)
While you wastin' your time spittin' the rhymes
I'm gettin' mine spittin' them rhymes, but still pitchin' them dimes
And the spot still sick with da grime
Glock 26 nigga but I'm sicker than nine
I'm live with the pound, small silencer calmin' the sound
Stick with the seven, strickly smith with the seven (shit)
When I drop back and cock back
And pop that, I'm poppin' for keeps
I'm not gettin' stopped in the streets
Imagine that a nigga tryin' to rock Mack
Only nigga did it was Jay and he did it when I signed the contract
[Chorus: x2]"
still-got-love-for-you,2001,beanie-sigel,Hip-Hop,"For the record y'all, uh-huh
I know you hear me, for the record y'all
Dynasty album, track 16, listeners fret
I can't take back that sixteen
Shit the truth spoke, I gotta give the world true quotes
Can you feel it? I know the truth hurts
They say, ""How can he disrespect his pop with harsh curses?""
Simple - harsh life, harsh verses
""I can't believe the mouth of this prick
He said put his mouth on his dick,""
I know we gotta talk bout that, I know you salt bout that
You on the tip like I don't like you
I got four kids, three baby mothers, I'm just like you
Sometimes I wanted to just fight you, shit
Swing on you - think I'm playin man, I'm just like you
I was a kid with a puzzle
With missing pieces tryin to put it together dawg, you put it together
You made me have to foot through the weather
In the storm with no raincoat
I don't only speak on me, I speak upon the kids in the same boat
Ridin the same water, same situation
Same fatherless daughter - I hate you, that's in your mind
Don't get caught up in the rhyme
You think I dissed you now, that I don't miss you now
Don't be a hater now, be glad I made it now
I know I probably rubbed you the wrong way
But fuck what the song say, for the record, check it
[Chorus]
Still got love for you, though you left me in the cold
To face this world alone, and make it on my own
I still got love for you, but I just can't fight the pain
It's so hard not to hate, but you grow up in a way
Listen - that was my hurt in my heart talkin, along with the truth
I would thirst often as a youth cause of you the person
Moms nursing self-esteem issues
Round the house it's hard to find a clean tissue, minus her tears
To rewind this time I promise I minused my years
To the day to take the pain away
Seemed sunny outside, always rained on Jay
Pop you my umbrella, come help your son with the weather
Soon we come together like man and man and build
Play space, cards face up, I've come to deal
In order to get right we gotta deal with this wrong
And the pain I felt all my life you feel in the song
Your lack of warmth left a chill in the morn'
Your lack of love, left me loveless, and I'm of your breath
I'm your mind body and soul, your heart, your flesh
Your alcohol, your smoke, in results I'm a mess
And dad, still I love you no less dad
Hope you didn't think success would make me less mad
But not mad, just disappointed - we wasted years
I swear to God, may you take me away from here
If you taught me anything
The one thing you taught me is to face my fears, coward
How could you let me grow without you?
Grind in this rap game, take dough without you?
Wear my Pro Keds close to the sole without you?
Family pictures pose without you - WHY?!
Why shouldn't I be mad?
Monster's parents separated, Monster had his dad
These parents had they problems, he still came to the pad
He bought 'em new bikes, imagine what that felt like
Used to have to butt my head to go to sleep at night
Nigga you did me wrong but the love is strong, let's move on"

These niggas ain't sayin shit man
These niggas on mute man
I'ma make you blind motherfuckers feel some real
[Sigel]
Aiyyo the guc is here dog I'm back to work
I took time off a couple niggas had to get hurt
Due to the fact they wack and wasn't strapped
Packin they gat, now they layin' flat
In six in green (you know wut I mean?)
Man I need a new gat for that
Yo, I'm the coke copper plus the rock chopper
Down wit M. Bleek, the Marcy prock clocker
One wreck, the other destroy
And with that bullshit vest on, I'm killin' your boys
I don't play when it come to yae
I cop cook and collect my dough in one day
Book rock and collect my dough at one show
False looks, Memph let one go from the floor
[Memphis Bleek]
Yo, yo
Well I'm known to be the master in the M.C. field
Oh-oh got respect, oh-one I still
Tote guns to the show and then I jet wit a hoe
Bitch niggas want to front and get clapped
Get on the floor, clap a second time
And make sure I flat-line you
Let a whole round go, hit niggas behind you
See the gleam on the glock, know the beam on top
Get shot, popped, and drop, yo the team is the Roc
As I glance at Mack, a-k-a B-Sigel
Know we comin' with the macks and the extra Eagles
I'm not playin, you dudes know what I'm sayin'
I make a call to my dogs, them niggas comin' through sprayin'
What you sayin?
[Chorus]
[Sigel]
I'm puttin heads to beads, gun straight out the box
B-Sige, I put up all the roofs and glocks
I'm not playin, see these guns that I'm sprayin?
Twin sub oozies, can't budge or move me
Nickels stay chubby, smokers never choosy
Don't gotta yell up the block, they come to me
Packs with colorful tops just like coochies
New jacks with they pack they like, who he?
I'm not playin, knock them things off quick
Got game still think off shit
What you say?
[Bleek]
With a partner like Sigel, don't come a dime a dozen
We could be brothers, we better known as cousins
As we climbed the chart with who the fuck want what
My hood to your hood, we showed the world crew love
Who want to play with that Roc-A-team?
Know that I tote that thing that knock sixteen
You walk around talkin' this and that
How I sound like Jay and all my records is wack
But when I dropped the LP, niggas thought it would fold
Thirty days later, Coming of Age went gold
What you sayin?
[Chorus]
[Sigel]
Now party people it's time for this question
No knock knock, who's that? who's there? or who is it?
It's the M-A-C-K
Yes the gun clapper, the duct tape, rope, black mask and kidnapper
The flow dope, the beats just blazin
Like Luther Vandrow says, yo 'I am so amazing and I've been waiting'
For a sucker to attack the cat with two gats
Yo Bleek, you got my back, show 'em how we do
[Bleek]
Yo, I fight fire with fire, I make crews retire
I spit 9 to 5 nines, Bleek for hire
Your crew murderize, see the guns that I'm bringin
In an all out battle, Bleek come out swingin'
Memph the type of nigga that'll spit off quick
Biggs push the Benz and we spin off quick
Take a sip of the Cris pour the Belvy with lime
Crack the Arma del Lope and then I'm goin for mine
So what you sayin?"

Fuck with that money paper then
Light as a rock, gonna light up the block
Don't believe in cases, goin all out
Paintin' faces, switch my picture, like tradin' places
For that money what?
Everybody hands up, or hands down money tucked
I flip the money trucks, money I don't give a fuck
Ay money, shut the fuck up
It's only a stickup
You don't stand a chance, give it quick up
You 'bout to turn into an ambulance pickup
Enough with the cocky stuff, fuck all that stocky stuff
Don't get smacked like a hockey puck
I ain't wit' that rocky stuff
I'm strapped got this gat (Blah blah blah blah)
What?

It seems so simple, like there was nothing to it
One more time run through it, everybody hands up
Alright hands down money tucked

I'm on fire like a molotov cocktail
I'm high off them cocktails
Dangerous gone broke, my aim is no joke
Duct taped, roped, strangle your folks
Box cut across the throat (nope)
Bang the four 'till it's broke
Prey on niggas in a circlular pattern
Catch you playin' craps, car in reverse
I'm circlin' back
Man I stay up in them dice games, fuck a ice chain
A Ice ring, I'm tryin' to come up on some nice change
Incase a nigga might swing, they gets a might thang
Pull out the right thang, show em it's a spike thang
Make you do the right thing, like a Spike Lee joint
Bang that pussy and his right knee joint
You get the sergeant and cap couldn't tell mack (freeze)
I'm like a rat dodgin' traps when it come to the cheeze
Backwards wrapped my trough
Won't hesitate to clap ya folks
I'm on tilt like a rapid (?)

Back now nigga, all black down nigga
Mack now, loaded up wit' black towns nigga
Frontline, clap down, backround niggas
One nine clap crowns, and smack down niggas
Keep rope to hogtie you pork ass niggas
Stuffin' the boot to shoot hoops you sports ass nigga
Wouldn't shoot a game of pool
8-ball in the corner pocket, stop it
You niggas flippin' Guess jeans profit
Disrespectin' eskell, expectin' to sell
You got seeds in ya weed, disrespectin' the L
Don't got 20's on ya wheels disrespectin' the car
You burnin rubber and that squad, disrespectin the tar
You niggas wore ass backwards, 'vessinal gat
Same thing with your hustle, rustled and packed
The ball back on missions
Drop the east the mack more vicious
Back to snatch or crack off dishes

Tryin to make it to heaven, still livin
Make a visit, stop by the weed spot grab a dub
I know grams gon' have me a grub

My favorite, a pot of rice and her stewed chicken
Hit the basement, holla at Uncle Doc
Nephew, wit Snu kickin
Where dudes, what's your new mission
We bust it up he cold frontin
I know this nigga wanna hold somethin
I know grams upstairs preppin for church
Matchin up her hat, shoes, pocketbooks and skirts

Even though I know he false teachin, damn

And I found peace right here in your arms
By the way, how you gettin along, huh?
I know it's been tough bearing the pain since daddy's been gone
But, all in all, you still stood tall and never shedded a tear
I'm thankin God you still here
Cause, only heaven knows all my heartaches and setbacks
Goin from a high school dropout to shovelin wet wax
I'm never gon' forget that, look in your eyes, look in your eyes
When you told me that my grandfather died
It was like nothing had happened, naw and I'm knowin that you miss him
But to accept death, is just the side of a good Christian
And I miss him, just words, and I lived it in life lived it in life
And I take it step by step, but I take it in Christ take it in Christ
Cuz I'm knowin I can't make it alone uh, uh
You told me not to buy you a new house because in heaven's your home
And as hurt as I was, I had to smile witcha
And thank God that we crossed paths cuz you one strong sister
And I'm never gon' forget ya
Heaven sent us an angel and the world gon' miss ya mama

Or hurt them or hurt we
I cursed see the worsest death
Beat you niggas to a thirsest breath
Off wit ya head niggas, fuck that all purpose vest
I'm ridin all out for Umi
Christian Caffer, though I follow the path of the Sunni
What can I do but bow down and give offerings
For the lady with the softest skin
Keep picturin grams tuckin me in
Breakin me out of her change purse
Slash teacher, slash preacher, slash changed nurse
One woman, ten boys, seven daughters
Three story house wit no supporter
Damn, you wanna get your life in order
Words from the oldest boy of your youngest daughter

Now you can find me, girlie behind me, holdin my mink up
Ice pinkie ring in the air, drinkin my drink up
Top down, 'dro in the air, blowin that stink up
It's seldom that I smoke, but it helps my thinker
Makes me a, mathematician about my math
Get celebrity ass, I'm a statistician - rap with precision
Nigga, your hoe chose Hov', that's rapid division
Now divide yourself and slide
I, young Vito, voice of the young people
Mouthpiece for hustlers, ventriloquist for jugglers
Took it where few went, made a few cents
Don't call me Hov' no more, call me _The Blueprint_
Sold dope (and) sold crack (and) sold soap (and) sold rap (and)
bought Bentley's, bought 'em back, nigga can you buy that??

Purpose for man - worship Allah, then you die
Purpose of my gun - run in yo' shop and take pies
Purpose of my son - raise him to do the same

Benz Coupes, Jags and trucks when we roll out
Man it ain't no lie, it's real as this four-five
And real as these five salaats, whether we Deen or not
Our kids gotta eat, red Beamer stops
where your connects gotta meet, interrupt your cop
Dependin on the dope size, we slide it from (?) size
With hammers with hollows you feel we follow we're both risin
They killed your cousin you strapped and you won't ride and
don't think cause I rap that I won't (?)
Play O-Dog in _Menace_ and drive-by men
Real gangsters keep a bitch in the wheel, workin the gas tank
Hoes on the strip, bringin that cash in

Omillio Sparks, the young gun
My life as an adolescent, said I'll go through something
Other guys try to stand in my way like brick walls
So I kept guns in my palm like Messiah scripts in Psalms
I should fear no man but God
So, Lord knows we could get it on
Guns baptized guys testing my pride
Clearing my conscience in the liquor store
With a fifth of Thunderbird, but I be guzzling hard
Playing the corners with a washed-up old-head
Chant tunes by the Whispers
Same corner where I banged at with niggas
Cops drive by and grin on us
If they grabbed then
One of them nosy neighbors done snitched on us (Again?)
Hey, this game juicy got me puffing loosies
Every two days interrogated by the police
See, this life I live cost more than your Roley's money
It cost my homey Nook his whole life, ya heard me?
When he was here, it was easy to love him like a brother
Now that's he's gone I find it difficult to talk to his mother
I mean, what do you say to a woman
That's just lost her only son to the game and the gun, except
""Mami, I'm a ride for him.""?
The look that she gave me like, ""Sparks, you got some nerve.""
'Cause most of these niggas don't keep their words
Now I'm under pressure
And I can't even break that type of promise
And y'all niggas paint that picture
Risking your freedom
On the strength of memories of him
The time he made you laugh
The time he bust his gat when them other niggas ran
How real is that?
Omillio Sparks, niggas, holla back
[Beanie]
Tales of a hustler
[Chorus x 2]
In this life you not promised tomorrow
So take the bitter with the sweet and maintain
In these vicious streets
Carry your heat, and keep your mind on your money
Life's a gamble; everybody got a number, homey
Tales of a hustler!
[Beanie]
I'm back to the block with it
Wait, let me clear that up
I'm back to the blocks that you get when your block get it
Get hard with that hot water when the pot hit it
Get large with a little water when you pop wit' it
I send hope to late scramblers
Sling coke to you late you scramblers
Go broke, sling soap to you late night scramblers
No joke, I'm a crook; catch hooks broke; late night gamblers
Look, you loose limbs when fuck with him
That be I strapped and high
FBI all on back, want to trap the guy
Got niggas in all black want to snatch my pies
Never that, too many gats
Too many guns
Too many vests
Tough guys, not too many left
Where they at?
Dead or locked behind bars in jail
I know I ain't too far from hell
I'll spit the devil these bars in hell
Dog, I been through it, son
Look at my scars and tell
Catch Mac in a Chevy truck slightly tented
No excuses on who might be in it
You know passenger twisting backwoods
Slightly spinning
Crack the window, the indo slightly scented
Splash of haze and hash lightly blended
Put the pressure on niggas who might be timid
Like, you got like a minute
To put the cash in this bag or ya ass just might be in it
In small piece, I'll snatch your family up
Start from tall nephews to your small nieces
Bitches

Jot down numbers on small pieces of paper

Breaks down doe over a hoe?
Spend my chips over a trick?

Spend cheese, say please, and lace a hoe
Man, all my bitches know to suck me off and hit the door
Especially if I hit before, They know the rutine,
Dick to jaw, I don't give a bitch shit but game
And spit that like Rudy Raymoore
Man my whole squad play on tours
That's all we do is play on whores
That's up to you if you pay for yours
I might let 'em run around in the apartment
Just don't steal shit or spill shit on the carpet
You know the address, apartment 3F
Find you, fuck you, and flee, and my man Bleek next

what-your-life-like-pt2,2001,beanie-sigel,Hip-Hop,"c'mon let's try this Guru
When I was five years old, I realized it was a road
But at the end, I ain't seen lots of pots of gold
I seen a long cell block, the box, the hold
Six hundred fenced in, some innocent, some rotten souls
Some men with men, stop it, whoa
I ain't runnin' up in shit but a broad on her back
Tryin' to cop a small hammer, move out like Shawshank
with Redemptions, I got my mind on revenges
They tryin to kill me at the same time keep me alive
I'm movin' out like Adebisi on +Oz+
With my skully on tilt, two whacks in my palm
Posted up in the yard, everyday I think of pokin' the guard
Throw a crack a nigga turnin' me in
Tryin' to crack a nigga turnin' me thin
Food soakin' in lard, news fools get opened in cards
with ?, in this prison life, what you livin' like?
[Chorus]
Can you tell me what you live like?
Can you tell me what that bed like, what's that cell like?
What's livin' in hell like? Tell me do you eat right?
Do you even sleep right?
Yo, tell me what your life like
Tell me do you sleep nights, tell me what that life like?
Gettin' no kites like, no flicks like
Make you want to quit life
Them four letters is a motherfucker
That's forever like a motherfucker
Without a letter from a motherfucker?
It ain't even bout the cheddar from a motherfucker
Write a kite, some flicks from a motherfucker
Some drawers, some socks, some kicks from a motherfucker
I can't believe I'm doin' this bid for you motherfuckers
I'm down for another joker case
I was dealt this hand, and I'ma play it with my poker face
On the block ready to poke a face
I got an L goin' around with a smokin' case?
You steal the deodorant out of CVS, you locked for retail theft
I got it body half a block stolen DT vest
My rap sheet read three D abreast
Dangerous, duct tape daughters
I take to the street, like a duck take to water
Get your duck game in order
My bust game in order, I fluffs 'caine with water
[Chorus]
That's fucked up, you bout to take your longest trip
and can't do shit, but suck it up, be strong and shit
Handcuffed, ankle to wrist, in back of the bus
Flashbacks of you back in the world
Can't fuck now you thinkin' bout who in back of your girl
Got her ass up (kill this bitch) playin' your crib
Thinkin' bout who raisin your kids
Shit was all good a week ago, 'fore they came and raided your crib
6:30 in the morning, they kick your door in
Feds pour in, snatch you out your bed while you snorin'
You unaware of what's goin' on and
Come to find out, clients you had for years, turned to foreman
Told the law about the drops you make
How your clientele first started to escalate
Givin' him keys to your crib, was your next mistake
At that dinner table, breakin' out that extra plate
You can't turn a career addict off his coke habit
Put him on post with the toast that promote static
Back to the operation, they got you locked at the station
Fuck your back time, you worryin' about what you facin
Heart racin', situation gettin' scary
Old clients are showin' up, at the preliminary
D.A. tryin' to bury a nigga to Neveruary, 31st
God damn, that gotta hurt"
nothing-like-it,2001,beanie-sigel,Hip-Hop,"I'm just a picture in a frame
man, I paint word pictures on the canvas of life
but I don't control the colors
Yo, I'm ten steps ahead of niggas, that shit scary
sometimes I feel ahead of myself
I hear this voice in the back of my mind
like ""Mac maintain, just grind, dog, better yourself""
So what I do?, I take heed and pick up the pace
can't explain it when I pick up my son & look at my face
I'm like a black rose growin' in the concrete crack in the pavement
there that voice go again ""Mac practice for greatness,
get paid for them immaculate statements""
Keep thinkin of them hotlines, like a physic, I can't explain it
There's no pen when I write it, there's nothing like it..
God damn, what you want from me, what you want me to tell you huh?
Niggas thought that I would stutter huh, thought I was dumb
But I ain't used to use my mind, I used to just... use my 9
and run wild with my boys, in the streets wild with these wars
now the Qu'ran and 48 laws, they polish my floors
I'm moving niggas like puppets with no strings attached
It's nothin' for Beans, so you know it ain't a thing for Mac
to look in your eyes, see through your heart, know what you fearin'
pick you apart, like you niggas is transparent
(I see right through you niggas)
It's like Mac was born with advanced parents
I'm like the Sun shining at night,
imagine it dog, I know you want to see me gradually fall
but I'm walkin on air, braking every gravity law
nothing like it...
I spit words that skip through air
let the words of a true thug hit your ear,
it change colors like blue blood when it hit the air
it's nothin' like it...
God damn, shit, I can't explain it
Fuck y'all niggas
I changed my whole life.. in about 9 months, just like sperm in a womb
these young niggas never learn 'til they doomed
try to tell them ""you can burn young punk, without smelling the fuse""
make you shiver in the middle of June,
paintin' pictures so vivid, you can hang it up in your room
shine bright like a prism, displaying colors like Crayola
think of the prisons with straight soldiers
think about the niggas who fucked us and played over us
think about the mothers who suffered and prayed over us
Just look at the the picture I've painted, it's so perfect
open your eyes motherfuckers, you can't duck us
no survivors every soul shall suffer,
I'm loadin them revolvers every shell shall touch ya
I promise I'll light your ass with these mags, I'ma bust ya
God damn it's nothin' like it, I'm serious
can't explain how I write it.."

I was high off vodka, hydro, and malt liquor
Die cause I knew I shoulda laid that man
Die cause the cops tricked me ta say that man
Die cause I hesitated ta spray that man
Die cause I hesitated ta pay that man
Die cause my man passed me a empty tool
Die cause I panicked, I couldn't keep my cool
Die cause I mixed all them pills wit Hennessy
Or die cause them niggas in jail, envied me
Die tryin' ta steal the fate of my enemy
I could go out from a case of mistaken identity
Or die cause the door wasn't open, it was locked
Die cause the 4 was broken, it wouldn't cock
Die cause a nigga wasn't focused on the block
Die cause them niggas thought tha coke was in the spot
Die cause another nigga said I said somethin'
Die cause that newsy bitch said I did somethin'
Die cause a nigga was tryin' ta get a name
Or die cause it was just my time ta feel the flame
Might get sparked, might not feel no pain
Or Might go out like dark-skinned Jermaine
Take a couple shots ta the heart, or ta the brain
Got all the dough, don't know the cost of the game
Young buck didn't wanna come off the chain
Couldn't handle the rock, got horsed in the game
I could catch a bad break like Big or Pac
I'd rather go out in the masjid makin' salat
We chapters of the same book, just a different page
Niggas of the struggle all out ta get paid
Doin' what we gotta do to avoid the raid
Avoid the cage, but you can't avoid the grave
We chapters of the same book, just a different page
Niggas of the struggle all out ta get paid
Doin' what we gotta do to avoid the raid
Avoid the cage, but you can't avoid the grave"

What
Spit what man
Man I don't know where that shit be comin' from dawg for real
Ain't no fuckin' rapper man
Sixteen
I don't know Jay
If you don't believe me then
Who you know who can spit till he pop the real
Never thought about rappin' 'til he coped his deal
I really held down my block for real
All I do is crack rock and how to pop the steel
How to box niggas in where they can barely move
Roll wit straight thugs never scary dudes
Keep bodies on them guns and we share our tools
Deuce one ball for Philly like Larry Hughes
Keep the desert eagle wit the beam tucked by the scrotum
Get locked in jail run a block sell open
Mind went to jail I get dro el's roll 'em
Rookie nigga clippin' niggas like L Odom
I got dough I choose not to spend it
Catch me in Avis and Budget in somethin' rented
Long as the windows tented (I don't give a fuck)
I'm in it
I was holdin' wit music rollin' in the gold infinite

We don't complain thats just how it be

I hustle through the alley through the valley of the death
And I never play fair in the eyes of the ref
Fuck it give me a tech and I'll come back right
Can't go inside the game ain't got enough strikes
Come at me wrong I'll come at you the same
Come at me sideways I'll come blastin' your brains
Come at me direct and I'll come back wit names
I'm hot like boilin' water, I'll come back wit cane

Do anything for a game to catch some change
Whether it was shootin' the dice or clappin' the gauge
I was a nigga wit a strong arm like Satchel Paige
I'm tellin' you dawg I'm the wrong one to fuck wit at all
I'm the type that'll set a broad day in the mall
Up in glocks wit body shops takin' a fall
Fuck you cock swats feds and all

No no no homie, I didn't say I could hit you wit dirty o's
But I said if I can supply 30 of those
Ding ding homie come holla at the kingpin
The gods are reapal, the Carters is lethal

Came up singin' that god was evils
Slang Heron to cats is like revolvin' a eagle
And I blew to the point I bought cars for the people

If you a playa, get it now like a playa
Get it down like a playa, spit a round like a playa
If you a playa, roll an ounce like a playa
Get an ounce like a playa, bounce like a playa
If you a playa, get it now like a playa
Get it down like a playa, spit a round like a playa
If you a playa, get an ounce playa, bounce, playa
Bounce, bounce, bounce
When I step in the club, bitches know my name
I don't do a lotta talkin' bitches know my game
Don't gotta buy a lotta drinks bitches know my aim
Y'all get them whores drunk just to get some brain
When the Roc in the place, they go berserk
We make em bounce till they motherfuckin' shoulders hurt
Bitches lift up skirts, take off shirts
Fine babysitters take off work
Lose they jobs, panties, shoes and bras
Niggas mad at us 'cause they lose they wives
I don't step up in the club without a weapon in the club
'Cause niggas get drunk and kick crap up in the club
That's why my tool be cocked, niggas mad 'cause my shoes be blocked
And my jewels be rocked
If you a playa, you wouldn't be in my pocket
If you a playa, you like it, you see it, you cop it
[Chorus]
If you a playa, you got the three basic niggas
Your trick your lick and your dick niggas
The object never fall in love wit 'em
Run to the malls and the clubs for them
If you a playa, then you choose 'em like a playa
Use 'em like a playa,then you lose 'em like a playa
I bet I'll still be they favorite bitch
Some bought me ice, some paid for whips
C'mon you know the rules in this playa shit
Ain't no such thing as a relationship
If you a playa, get it now like a playa, get it down like a playa
Spit a round like a playa
If you a playa, roll an ounce like a playa, get an ounce like a
Playa, bounce like a playa
If you a playa, bounce, bounce like a playa nigga, bounce, bounce
[Chorus]
Jiggaman ya heard?
If you a playa, will you pull up to the curb
Niggas chicks fly the coup when you pull up to them birds
Why the fuck would you bring her
When the rocks on that man got his whole hand lookin' like E-T's finger
If you a playa, keep your cars with the year (year)
Your watch game tight (tight) your hustle over there (uh-huh)
Your house outta sight, your enemies close
And your family tight and never try to make a ho your housewife

Niggas want to know if Beanie Sigel life is real
Nigga twenty-five ta life is real
I get a body, take me right ta jail
I know what it's like in hell
I did a stretch in a triflin' cell
What you know about twenty-three and one
Locked down all day, underground, neva seein' the sun
Vision stripped from you, neva seein' your son
You got bricks on the strip, neva see 'em get done
What you know about all day
Them Little Debbies and them Chi Chi's, they makin' you sick
You gotta wash out your drawers same water you shit
Brush, gargle, and spit same water you piss
You down wit this nigga, you done killed his brotha
But dog, don't think he don't know it
Think he a sucker 'cause he don't show it
Paybacks a muthafucka, and he won't blow it
What you know about them 4 letters, not the kind you write
Or the kind you sit down and type
Sign at the margin, get it right
I'm talkin' 'bout that real time
Life like Eddie or Martin
Ta my niggas, that's up the fort
When I get there fuck a pack, hand me a log
And a push rod toilet sword
So when I hit these niggas up they can't call the guards

Tell me what your life like

What you know about solitary
Locked down, no commissary
And you wild or ready
And you just seen your mom get buried
You got drowns, comin' in all kinds of flurries
What you know about your towel on your cell when you alone at night
Or a jailhouse hunger srike
Or you sittin' in your cell and just zone one night
And you think ""damn, I'm neva comin' home one night""
You got 5 years in, neva been flown a kite
You hearin' grown men moan at night
They got you stuck in the can
White man got you fuckin' your hand
Your wife on land fuckin' your man
What you know about no parole
Life in the hole
Lifes cold, you be eatin' them swags
Guards on the nightshift they be beatin' you bad
The hardest nigga turned bitch, be sleepin' wit fags
What you know about gettin' and shippin' balloons
Keep switchin' positions in the visitin' room
Gotta take Ex-Lax, hope you did it in time
Gotta shit in your palm just ta get the heroin
And you talkin' 'bout your life is this, your life is that
Your life ain't shit, your life is whack
Man you listenin' ta the realest nigga
Close your eyes, muthafuckas tell me you don't feel this nigga
The illest nigga

Why niggas can't never just play they part
Gotta be the first ones that say they talk
Say they shared , first ones to say they did
Can't never be they self gotta play that kid
You know the same young buck you let touch the coke
And now that he come up he want to cut your throat
And you gave from the block , put em to your neck
Now he givin you a glock puttin it to your neck
You know that same bitch said don't fuck with him
That nigga no good ain't no trust in him
Two days later see her in a truck with him
Two years later now that bitch stuck with twins
That nigga been broke why now she fuck his friends
Got a lap dance in bars and touch them ends
Time uncovered a veil over people's plots
And the dumb shit they do to get on top
CHORUS: Nafeisa and Beanie Mac
Everybody wants to be a star
Everybody want to be a star , don't want to be who they are
Everybody wants to be a star
Every bitch want to hop in your car , every hater want to give you scars

Man every fucking day , these no flow niggas
Always in my face , with they promo niggas
I thought I told y'all , I don't know Jigga
I'm not Beanie Sigel , and I don't flow neither
What happened to your keys and dreams of being cracklords
Now it's Trinities , MP's and trackboards
I switched my hustle to get this cream
Now everybody and they mom want to spend $16
I got niggas wastin they change to get in this game
Like shit gon change when they get in this game
You think it's just rhymes and beats
Man this shit's stress time and heat , deadlines to meet
Everybody want to come cry to me , come spit they little lines to me
You shouldn't of lied to me , naw dog you can't rhyme wit me
Like you tied to me , like I don't see what you tryin na be
CHORUS (addition)
Stop tryin na be a star, be who you are
Maybe you will go a little far

Man I ain't gon lie I thought all the glitz was gold
And like Jay (I watched the truth unfold)
And now that I got a little time in with this rhymin
I found out everything that shine ain't a diamond
Everything that come in a jar ain't dro
ain't no use you spittin them bars you can't flow
ain't no use you gettin that are if it don't glow
And ain't no use you gettin a car if you can't go
Get out the streets , haters will draw you back
Like an automatic weapon that'll pull you back
Load somethin in the brain just to see you snap
I try to maintain but I see they trap
See they plot , you can see me not
You can be me not , niggas want to see me bopped , see me locked
See me in the block , send me shots , do anything to be on top

Even though I got signed I'ma still slang thangs
Verse 1
Ay yo I cop power pellets (and y'all call 'em bricks)
I make little dots (and y'all chop rocks to flip)
Before junior, they had me out on a chase
Running from these ghost monsters y'all calling the jakes
All I do is stack loot
Run around and eat fruit
And harass these lady cops named Pinky and Sue
My whole life been a maze in a chase
Can't keep still without these monsters on my back invadin my space
I got two hitmen that'll bury you brothers
They rule the underworld
you know'em as the Mario brothers
Straight cannons
And won't hesitate to shoot you
And they stay goin to war wit that latin King Koopa
I got a worker named Frogger
When I say jump he leap
A highway boy who be runin the streets
Wit that package
Dodgin through traffic that's narrow
And my nigga Donkey Kong bringin weed in by the barrels

Verse 2 (Missing Verse)
I take over blocks section by section
Shake under cover cops and make 'em change direction
They best bet is to relax and chill
Sonic couldn't catch me I'm good at track and field
I might run up in your spot
When I'm runnin' from the cops
Sling work a Dime a dot
A hundred a rock
I give out cooked
Yeah But I only get raw
And I keep a nice stash in case I have a Pitfall
I got a worker named turtle that be movin my snow
He bring strait dough
He just move it too slow
I don't fuck with them crabs I had to blast those boys
I caught them breakin down my rocks like asteroids
Met ms. pac told she could go on a mission
But first she got to let me put in pole position
I wish I woulda knew then what I now know sooner
Cause 10 towns later here come pac Jr.
Chorus 2X
Verse 3
I got drugs for every race, color, and creed
I sling mushrooms to white boys in club Centipede
Donkey Kong was gettin money from slinging weed
I don't know why he want to start a pie factory
We can be partners
That's murda, us connecting
Wit the right blow
And Burger Time doing the cheffin
We can get doe
Can't let the cops catch us
And if it move slow (still stack blocks like tetris)
Whoever don't want to get down, they stupid
Not the one to jump around these blocks like Q-bit
Ain't nobody out there making no noise
Wit they own route but that nigga Paper Boy
We can take his stuff
He ain't tough he a nut
He always letting Dig Dug pump em up
I pull a plug on 'em niggas if they don't want to set it

Real thugs stand up straight they never fold
And they don't know shit if anything ever blows

Lay back, exhale, put the heat up
No stress, no scale, no jail could keep us
Only case we catching now would be a misdemeanor
Remember we used to hustle thinking life would cheat us
Not knowing if we struggled life would treat us
Think on how mommy carried us
Where life gon lead us
Knowing if we getting married
Our wife will need us
If at one time you could look into my mind
When I close my eyes and remember them times
No gas, had a hot plate heat our dinners
No cash, most nights ate sleep for dinner
Welfare and white landlord, that life ain't easy
The only ones moving up was George and Weezy
All my sugar water babies who live in autos, it's crazy
Keep it in the dark, I'm-a speak it from the heart

Every day my mom cooked with lard
Fucked up I couldn't feed myself
Living life no means of wealth
Eating shit I can't believe myself
That's not a joke
Man I was dealt these cards and I played dem out
Yeah the road was rough but I made a route
Now picture running extension cords from your neighbor's house
To get lights, fuck Max on the latest routes
Used to close my eyes try to fade it out
Dumb niggas in the hood think I made it out

Yo every day I think Deke and Rola
From introducing me to Dame and Hova
Ever since that day I met Jay
Man I knew my pain was over
They let me in this game it's over
Mom I know I put you through hell
But now I'm gonna order you heaven
No more temporary layoffs like Florida Evans
Ain't no good times about dat there
Your boy rhyme now, it's fine now
We out dat there
Fuck that Access car
I'm-a work extra hard
To turn that into a platinum express car
You can have sweet dreams at night
Your boy ain't out there with dem toys and them pings at night
All dem cracks and the gats left that life alone
It's the tracks and the raps and the microphone
Wish y'all would fuck that up now
Shit it's all good now
We out the hood now

The truth, nothing but the truth
[Beanie Mac]
I hope you got an extra mic and a fire proof booth
'cause you know I'm known to metal wire too
You need a fire engineer when I lay this blaze
I melt down cracks that's real to save
Hit the studio, jars of dro, bars to blow
B. Sigel with that arsenic flow
Fuck that, don't hold me back
I roll with crack, y'all cats told Mac to rap
y'all don't realize y'all released the beast untame
Speech all flame, streets y'all blame
It should be an honor for y'all to speak my name
I could go before your honor sit and peep my game
Gotta laugh, y'all acted like it spit it the same
Why you motherfuckers can't get in the game
I come from high school, and go straight to the league
Who you know who can spit at the Sig
CHORUS 2X
Nigga the truth, every time I step in the booth
I speak the truth, y'all know what I'm bringing to you
I bring the truth, you motherfuckers know who I be
I be the truth, what I speak shall set you free
Nigga the truth
[Beanie Mac]
ain't nothin changed with Sig I'm still stuck in the kitchen
So what I'm signed, that's fine still stuck in position
You motherfuckers know me well, couple court cases from jail
Couple 4-4 shells from hell
Stuck on this mission, go home, my girl fussin and bitchin
Motherfucker won't you change your life, I'm thinkin
Motherfucker won't I change my wife
Ignorant bastard laughin like fuck the rap shit
It's just another hustle, another way for niggas to touch you
Now they know the face of Beans
Now they, see my face on screens and I ain't even chase this dream
I feel sorry for those who did
y'all niggas can't stop the boar, whether rock or raw
I'm slingin coke in a rock valor
You niggas know what block I'm on, glock in palm
You want to get shot, karate chopped or stabbed this song
Motherfucker

Black Friday management, and Roc's the label
And I still hit you niggas with shots that's fatal
That bullshit vest can't save you
I had a doc open you up from chest to navel
See my face on cable, and have flashbacks of that cold ass table
And them hoes I gave you
I'm that nigga that'll come and pour salt in your wound
At the hospital, while the cops guardin your room
You gotta see what I've seen, look where I've looked
Touch what I've reached, and take what I've took
You gotta go where I've gone, walked where I've walked
To get where I'm at to speak what I've talked
You gotta lay where I've laid, stay where I've stayed
Play where I've played to make what I've made
You gotta move what I've moved, use what I used
Use tools how I use, use fools how I use

Rubbin' down shorty's spine, she is fine!

If their hair is bad, then I will weave 'um

Nobody to book nobody to look

But you don't know what I have seen
From the bitches to the riches, to the triple beams
The project bricks the old school kicks
The early mornin' capers and the late night flicks
But since I moved on things ain't the same
I chose rap you chose the game

See your mom still strugglin' you up in the pen
But mom just wonderin when the end gon end
When the guns gon stop from spinnin' the bin
Or when the hood gon block the dope in the pen
Or when the light shot out you up in the park
The white trunk out your homey got marked
Or every nigga, that talk or rat in his heart
Or every nigga, that talk should die in the dark
I never forgot you and what we did
And how we came up and where we lived
I'm seven forever turn coke to never
Hard head 'til I'm dead until I'm 'bout my cheddar
Gotta get my ends wanna push a Benz
Eat steak live great and raise my twins
I can't believe I'm talkin' to ya' now that ya' gone

Now I'm just sitting there, lookin at the beaver
Its Hairy like Barry and its bigger than Geneva
Something said stick my finger in it so I did
Then came the 2, the 3, the 4, the thumb and aww shit

My fist, my wrist bitch, you need to summer's eve it
Douche ya bush black, you smell like stepback

A bitch that's 'bout hustlin' and smugglin' work
Head bustin' and thuggin' just like Turk
A wild bitch off Grave Street doin' her thing
Big ass, big tits, and she loved eatin' ding-a-ling
I need a black hoe, black hoe, one with the braids in her head
Workin' with some ass that could give good head
Can't forget about this bitch up in Philly on Richard Island
Freak-nasty bitch that's always swallowin'
Stickin' to the G-Code, Ree's, and Girbauds
Got hands and 'bout strappin', quick to beat a hoe
Oops, almost forgot about Tasha up in the watts
A hot girl for sure that stayed drop-me-like-it's-hot
Wherever it's poppin', we stoppin'
But if it ain't hot then, we not then
Wherever it's twurkin', we workin'
She got to be slurpin', that's for certain
Bitch, I'ma be stun'n until the day I go, what?
Bentley's and Hummers, and drop Di-a-blos, what?
Runnin' with niggas that don't love no hoe, what?
Platinum grill 'cause, bitch, I'm done with gold
Hey, now, you know it's Lil' Wheezy off the heezy
Believe me, whoa
Hot like pepper, slidin' out the Kompressor slow
Me and your wife, slut, don't slam my door
Cut on the lights, look how the damn watch glow
Hold up, Wayne, what
You know what, Wayne, whoa
I'ma get in this bitch and do donuts, man
Now wait, Bubble
You gon' make me go buy a Grape Hummer
And put my name in diamonds on the license plate, cousin
Now, peep me, slick
I got a hoe out the project that eat the dick
She a freaky bitch
Nigga, you know it's Iceberg, boy, straight off the block
With the number-one stunna, and we blazin' hot
What?
Wherever it's poppin', we stoppin'
But if it ain't hot then, we not then
Wherever it's twurkin', we workin'
She got to be slurpin', for certain
Wherever it's poppin', we stoppin'
But if it ain't hot then, we not then
Wherever it's twurkin', we workin'
She got to be slurpin', that's for certain"

Said I can't even when I could
I was stopped and tested fingerprinted and arrested
In my life In my life
Just say no when I really meant yes
I'm gon smoke all night til it hurt my chest
Slim told me over the years that shit gon tear up careers

Separate good from fake and the love and the hate

You went out like a soldier
And I still can't get over
What fake bitches done done
Got me clutchin my gun

All the good niggas die
Why some soldier gotta suffer
And mothers gotta cry
Why my daddie gotta lie

And if she say, ""What it is?"" -
To sleep with your sister and you

Come 'round the corner once, leave, switch up, come back around

Wrist hangin' out the window of the Jag with the top down

I'm a go all till a a whole a ain't nothin' but a tinkle tinkle
[Baby]
Now some of these hoes like to be fucked in the ass
Some of these hoes won't let you touch they ass
Some of these hoes like to be fucked fast
Some of these hoes know they need to be treated bad
Some of these hoes need to be kicked in they ass
Some of these hoes been gettin they old man stash
Some I play bad
Fuck other nigga hoes fast
And if yo bitch holla Beatrice
I put that dick in her ass
Nine times out of ten
She suck my dick when I blast
All because these hoes know I gotta gold and black Jag
[Chorus]"
hard-life,2000,big-tymers,Hip-Hop,"[Baby]
For sure, lil' one
I know what you're goin' through to shine
Niggas pullin' off all type of shit
But, look: if you don't know what you're doin',
you'd better catch the sideline
Catch the sideline
Nigga, the block look the same - it's just crack and cocaine
Niggas losin' but we still maintainin'
Livin' life like a penitentiary with a ki in my hand
Knockin' project bricks
Flippin' chickens, and movin' out quick
Hard-hustlin' 'cause we love slingin' this white shit
S.S., Monte Carlo's, hard-tops - we love that shit
'Bout two-hundred thugs with this clique
We multiply everyday for the bullshit
For the hood shit
Burned down buildin's ain't no good, slick
Niggas pullin' auctions on they own cars to get money quick
Then we dippin' and dabbin'
Goin' back to the labbin'
Lil' niggas payin' me for cookin' they slabbin'
Cook a brick and make it out a brick-and-halfin'
Chargin' them young g's ten G's for cookin' they slabs
Say, lil' wodie, I gots to have it
[Chorus - 4x (Juvenile)]
It's a hard life we livin' - they 'bout they drama
We earn stripes from killin' - attack like piranhas
[Lil' Wayne]
Look
Look
On the streets it ain't sweet
They be
It's not a game, homeboy - this ain't the NFL
Him just from rippin' with the mid-deck twelve
Hit the block in twin-SL's, and spit at gals
You get that, pal?
Once it's war, nigga, skip town
'Cause if I don't do it, be swimmin' with fish, clown
Now, crack a whole chick down, sell it in quarters
If the drama happen to hit town, I'm 'nappin' your daughter
If the broad try to flip out, I'm cuttin' her water
If your boys try to help out, I'm killin' they fathers
When and wherever
What and however - you bring it good
I'll have your mom singin' ""Hmmm hmm hmmm""
Cause nowadays lot of niggas got coward ways
So I ride with K's to knock off the side of heads
But I'm tryin' to stay man, I'm tryin' to stay focused
What I'm tryin' to say we gon' bust it wide open!
[Chorus - 4x (Juvenile)]
[Mannie Fresh]
What
What
Pimps, playas, riders, rollers, hustlers
Gangstas, thugs, criminal motherfuckers
Hit it, quit it, fuck it, leave it, flee
No evidence at your residence - that's me
Black, ugly, mean, sheisty bastard
Preachers and teachers sayin', ""I'm surprised you lasted.""
Guns, drugs, bitches hot sex
Weed, crack, heroin - what's next?
Feds, cops, killers politicians
Hookers, hoes, all on missions
Crooks, mayors, presidents, and leaders
N-double-A-CP, rednecks, and meat beaters
Mommas, baby-mommas, aunties and cousins
Scatter sites, knocked-out lights, projects by the dump
And cars, broads, murders ghetto life
I went through all that shit
for platinum ringers and a little bit of ice
[Chorus - 4x (Juvenile)]
[Juvenile]
I've been blessed
I thank the Lord everyday
for gettin' me from 'round these devils in these dark hallways
How the fuck you gonna help me when I don't care?
Niggas see me front it all - they just look and stare
And talk about how it should be and how it could be
Bentley in my basement - ain't nobody understood me
Take care of your people like you take care of your kids
'Cause money ain't shit when you don't know how to live
And niggas gon' pretend to be your friend when they ain't
You expect 'em to be there until the end, but they can't
Now, how many of you can say you're a real nigga?
Play the Prowler, but scared to go in the field with ya
You gon' know your nigga - he gon' be there, still with ya
Whether if it's talkin' or slingin' the steal with ya
Don't answer nobody questions
Gotta turn to the Lord with a confession

This is where them niggas die fast, sell bricks and buy bags
They dodge class to hit the block and go find cash
If you try to pass, take my advice, drive fast
'Cuz, my man, ain't no escapin' when shots blast
You wonder why the cops keep circlin', niggas murderin'
I ain't never saw 'em before, tonight we twurkin' 'em
Niggas wearin' masks like glasses
Niggas got on tank tops and a pair of Reebok classics
Pants to my knees 'cuz the glock make it slouch
I can't talk right now, I got three rocks in my mouth
And, wodie, when we enter, niggas freeze up like it's winter
And if a nigga whisper, pistols eat him up for dinner
Seventeen representer, you don't like it, do somethin'
And I'll bet you'll see a nigga outside 'bout two-somethin'
And we like to dress in all black up in my residence
Ain't got on no suits 'cuz we ain't tryin' to be presidents

Project bitches that tote gats
Niggas kickin' the dope, but the crack done smack back
Lil' niggas runnin' through the hallways
While other niggas playin' ball, made a court in the driveway
Things ain't the same where I use to play
It's guns and broads, new cars
Neighborhood superstars and hoes smokin' cigars
Lil' ones sittin' on the car watchin' the bus hollerin'
""Them people comin"" when that blue car pull up
I'm tired of catchin' cuts, and bendin' corners
I got that work, got youngsters on all four corners
You got the quarters, and you got them halves
I got the quarter ki's, and Fresh got the slabs
Ten a ki is the price if you want a brick
And if you don't know that, nigga, tax the bitch
Nigga, we done moved more coke

It's the return of the click-clackin', downtown pistol packin'
Y'all remember me from back in the '89 era
When killers use to wear mascara
And run through the court causin' terror
Random riot gunshots, government-issued glocks
That's bakin' soda added with that odor, now you got clatch pots
Niggas went from [unverified] to frozen cups
To catchin' cuts, to big ole nuts
Shorty, I been on missions
Jackin' niggas for Balley competitions
Stickin' guns in bustas' backs
Everybody, come out your Polos and your Zodiacs
But that was back in the days
See, niggas done changed they ways
Went from snug-nose-38's to hand grenades
Now it's a must that niggas bust back
When they get cussed at or fussed at
Nine-millimeters, glocks, pumps, riot guns, niggas can trust that
Nigga, we done sold more coke

Cause y'all motherfuckers be scheming, with a infrared beam in my rearview
But I ain't scared, been shot a few times but I ain't dead
Made some moves but I ain't red, on a block in Mo City ain't bled

Hustlers respect me, cause I spit everything that they live
I got a connect with the pills, and the good dro

I got a glock I keep it on me, I don't ever slip
Seventeen ain't enough, I rock with that extended clip
Thirty minus four, that's 26 so it don't jam
Run up if you want, you run straight into that blam-blam

War better for it, guns this is what
Shock him, without a cord

Get it how you live, be homeless or pay the bill
Drill a nigga or get drilled, kill a nigga or get killed

Stomp feet like alley cats, be on guard for all attacks
Always know what's up, the best set up's a yellow slut
If you set up by a slut, don't be ashamed and chop her up
That bitch was out of line, time to show naked spine
Don't leave no blood behind, use barets and terpentine
Say ain't tripping on shit, got teeth that shine and gliss
Watching them watching this, make other teams forfeit
Swear to God I got a lot of niggaz, I swear to God they all gorillas
I swear to God they'll kill a nigga, they specialize in end a temper
You simple you don't want none of me, kind of Tuck you ain't me

You want it go and get it, now fire come and get it

No money up front, you gon have no us
We gon burn off the lot, like man hol' up

I ain't never played sports, therefor I don't play games
Better ask these dudes, I will rock a nigga ass
And if your click pop off, I'ma slap they monkey ass
Gangsta-gangstafied, that's how we do it in the Dirty
Hit a weenie nigga, with a combination flury
Left-right-right-left, overhand with a quitter
Make room in this bitch, when DSR enter
Headed straight to the bar, to get about a bub
After that hit VIP, and fire up some drugs
Tell judge they didn't pay the deposit, I ain't going up
Rapping is tailored for us, so the game I'm sewing up
Tum Tum and San T, Southside and the 3
Putting it down from Tayhouse, all the way to Mississippi
All the gangstas in the place, all the hustlers in the place
All the thugs in the place, put your hood in his face
I ain't scared of no nigga, I ain't scared of no bitch
I don't bar no squad, and I ain't afraid of no click
It's the million dollar man, I get it popping in this bitch
Better watch what you say, 'fore shit start dropping round this bitch

I'm a do something bad to ya, disrespect your set talk trash to ya
And if you get out of line, I'ma bring it quick fast to ya
Smash your head, in the concrete
And H-Town Stomp, your bitch ass to the beat
Till they see the white meat, for playing games with my gang
My Hoggs off the chain, they'll dance on your brain
In the middle of the club, like fuck it
The laws see me, and act like they ain't seen nothing
You niggas bluffing, talking hard acting like you want beef
But when I see you on the streets, you hollin' bout you want peace
One or one hundred deep, I'm crush you and them busters
Straight smash on you suckas, you punks don't wanna tussle
My nigga Tuck, say we ready to ride
The whole Southside Dallas, waiting on the Southside
H-Town to the D, we connect in the Tex'
D-S-R and Boss Hogg, don't bar no plex we'll tussle with ya

confrontation,2005,damian-marley,Hip-Hop,"Mr. president, distinguished delegates,
Since the beginning of modern civilization
Generations have witnessed and inherited the only conflicts of world wars
But behold the marriage supper of the lamb and the bridegroom onto his bride
Then shall the earth's children know the true expression of one love
Then mother earth shall honeymoon in peace.
Forever eliminating the aspirations, lust and anguish of wars and rumors of wars, Selah!
See it deh know the innocent going up in vapors
And propaganda spreading inna the Sunday papers
not even superman coulda save you with him cape cause
Red-a judgement a blaze, blaze ya
And Babylon a gamble the youth dem life like racehorse
And gi dem a uniform and a shave dem head with razors
And now the clock a strike war, don't be amazed 'cause
Inna dem churches tryin' to save, saviors
Can we do it? we can do it, we shall do it!
Boom! Tell dem fe uh draw mi out when the world government inna falling out
Only few men survive crawling out
Run left him colleagues dem sprawling out, nearly dead!
Medic haffi haul him out
And give him two tranquilizer fi stall him out, deh pon base!
Can't get no calling out when him hear from the shout last week
Him mistress find a new shoes
Wife can't get no news and lately she starting to doubt, she still searching!
And the youth dem bawling out
Working hard not to let it all come out
Well it's not safe to go walk about
A slaughterhouse from Baghdad to water house
She start to arouse sometime she want a spouse
She start go out, start beat a darker stout, guns come out!
Working people funds run out
Keep a show last week and no one come out, bombs come out!
Mi gas tank just run out, bombo clatt!
The scotch tape just run out, weed run out!
Yuh senses must dumb out, mi have a pound round a back deh a gwan sun out
Nah come out! 'Til the chalice bun out,
Nah come out! 'Til the malice bun out, a war!
Zimbabwe to berlin wall
Blazin' like a burnin' ball, loose ball, dat no work, in war
Sleeping, dat no work..in war
Can't wear jheri curl, in war
No diamond and pearl, in war
Can't drink weh a serve, in bar
Gas wi fuck up yuh nerves, in war
Shot wi blood up yuh shirt, in war
Can't go lift up no skirt, in war
Now disease and germs, in war
Can't go release your sperms, in war
Stamina must preserve, in war
Fire constantly burn, in war
Red, it red, it red, it red, it red!
If you cannot do it, if you are not prepared to do it, then you will die.
You race of cowards, you race of imbeciles, you race of good for nothings
If you cannot do what other men have done
What other nations have done, what other races have done
Then you yourself shall die.

Hey, now wi fore parents sacrifice enough
Dem blood sweat and tears run like syrup
Any day a revolution might erupt, and the sky's over Kingston lighting up
For the new generation rising up, of youths now a days weh dem sighting up
And through reasoning dem biding up,
Searching for the sign and the sign is us,
Searching for the truth all you find is us,
Searching for the troops still behind is us,
The almighty we recruit and we come from the root
We build like roach building boot
Weh just can't done, Rastafari' design me tuff
If a the fight for freedom sign me up
Cause you tell-lie-vision can't blind me up
Soldiers and police dem wising up, realizing they're no more right than us
Realizing there's no use fighting us
Realizing their opening their eyes to see the same demoralizing life as us
So we nah tek talk nor smiling up
Cause the word temper tantrum boiling up,
And who alling the shots and nah bust none
Controlling the mind of the young, bring down
Bear famine, no rain nah fall from London to Dadeland mall
All the son of the virgin bawl, institute of the church in war
Preaching and researching war
Practice and rehearsing war
Teaching and dem learning war
Instigating and urging war
Always keep alert in war
Cause man will jump out a swerving car
Now bees and birds in war
And the freaks and nerds in war
And the straight and curves in war
Forward and reverse in war
Red, it red, it red, it red, it red
If you cannot do it, if you are not prepared to do it, then you will die.
You race of cowards, you race of imbeciles, you race of good for nothings
If you cannot do what other men have done
What other nations have done, what other races have done
Then you yourself shall die."
for-the-babies,2005,damian-marley,Hip-Hop,"This is real, this is real
Now I see them giving the woman abortion to kill another baby
Miscarriage and misfortune and premature crack baby
Strength of Ras Tafari I'm hoping someday maybe
They don't obey parents, maybe they will obey me
Future for the babies
Hopes for the babies
Tommorrow for the babies
No sorrow for the babies
Babies having babies
Raising our babies
All of these young ladies
Give them thanks and praises
How long can she take it?
Dreams are full of 'maybes',
Will she ever make it?
Hustles on a daily
In the club she shake it, strip down 'till she naked
Don't ever mistake it, Much too real to fake it
Need it then she'll take it
She'll do it for the babies
A mother's love is sacred
Now you don't you ever fail me
A woman needs caring, sharing, love all the time (no don't you ever fail me)
A child needs loving, caring
Is there no other option than adoption for you babies
You're raffling and jacketing and auctioning your babies
Strength of Ras Tafari I'm hoping someday maybe
They don't obey their parents, maybe they will obey me
Cowards play the game thing
Fathers do the brave thing
And that's participating
He keeps on concentrating
There is no debating
No running away thing
A new life is awakening, From his ejaculating,
It's in the oven baking
Takes two for the making
He's right there through the cravings
And early morning waking
School and educating
Sports and recreating, Karate and ballet thing
Teenager of today thing
Fathers still relating, still communicating
And they'll always embrace him
Cause they cannot replace him
A woman needs caring, sharing, love all the time (no don't you ever fail me)
A child needs loving, caring
And always do your very best to keep a promise to your babies
And if you can't be good, at least be honest to your babies
The strength of Ras Tafari I'm hoping someday maybe
They don't obey their parents maybe they will o
History of the babies
Beginning of the ages
You're flipping thru the pages
And up and thru the 80's
Some are gang related, Drug affiliated
Some intoxicated, Headed for the snake pit
And Papa's locked in cages
And Mama's lacking wages
And this what they're faced with, upon a daily basis
Bleaching out dem faces
Running from dem races
Shooting up them places
Killing other babies
As bitter as the taste is, And words can not explain it
Just walk the narrow pavement
And speak of love not hatred"

When strictly thugs used to run it
When one wheel really was the move
Long before Bogle start dance
And still pon deh paper money
Police alock up man fi them shoes

From England whe' spankin' new

Herbs and my locks, silky smooth way I flow
My words and my tracks
She's hoping we can spend a night at
Somewhere that's warm and cozy, why not?
She's been wanting me since my Karl Kani drop

Nashing of teeth and moaning upon bickering
Well, mind you catch the flow it can be sickening
Only a few are chosen for the reckoning
It's Rastarfari's that unno living in
And it's a lion's jungly unno visiting

Negative thinking, don't you waste your thoughts

Said she wants my loving all night
And when she get it, she'll be all right (all right)
Said she wants my loving all night
And when she get it, she'll be all right
[Verse 1: Stephen Marley]
Now she call me on the phone and said she's home alone
And she want me to come over and her house a home
Well I gave it to her once
And I liked how she responds
Well now i'm in trouble
Yeah
[Chorus]
[Verse 2]
It seems she needs to oil her spine
Tell all a gyal toast bread can't build di putty gold mine
Need all di doctor to fish with di essential slime
She tell me she want signal di plane n' time me want slow wine
Turn on di HBO she want fi watch Showtime
Give her di cordless microphone, she want di one with line
Seem like me and young gyal ya just can't combine
So it's sour like lime
Running it down the line Mr. Muffin one timr
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
She call mi pon di I-95
How mi ah tek so long she ah wonder which car mi drive
Tired fi listen album now and she want me live
Tell me she want mi fi come knock her out till she can't revive
SO!... Ah so mi planet and di stars align
She tell me she want me know which part her hills and valley dem join
Seh she want me ride her like a Ferrari sign
Put appointment aside
Nothing can't compromise
Fi di vibes I provide
BIM!
[Solo: Stephen Marley]
She wants my loving all night
When she get it, she all right
She wants my loving all night
[Verse 4]
I shouldn't make no physical contact, tell her fi hold down and still she just can't quiet
Seh mi tek her up and tun her inna $@# maniac
Telling me dat I compliment her natural habitat
Well... it seem like she deaf or she blind
Want come step inna mi life when time she deh far behind
Want mi play her rhythm till di tape want rewind
And she nah watch no time
And she just nah resign till she see the sunshine

So much man a flay down, call the pest control
Confident princess, she address them bold, she nah manifest
Fi dem sexual goal, she wish them the best, Rasta bless them soul
Her mouth nah filthy, like nuh cess tank pool
Smarter than most intellectual fools, weh spend dem time pon internet chat rooms

Well I seh baby you the cleanest, the true definition of what my queen is
Nothing coulda ever really come between us, share the same room and Jah will feed us

Wheel and pop off, supn' outta she purse, whole heap a fool have to start disperse
Police ah come you see how fast she splurt, can't find no sign of she khaki skirt
Light up the place like we spark there herbs, Love watch the way that she gwan
When a big tune a play pon the dance-hall set, selector rewind every chance dem get
The rhythm design fi she dance and sweat, all when morning a shine she nuh start dance yet
Man clear the line when she walk and sweat, but she nah pay no mind to remarks dem mek
Always on time tek a chance and bet, she's a fine piece of mind with the right mindset

Camouflage and fatigue is our style and fashion
""Fliminitti"" weh she have and that is the attraction, what she want is what she get and that is satisfaction
Well she want it all night and not jus fi a fraction, Well too much long talking now a time fi action, well she love fi spend money but she rather spend time
And if mi gone fi ten minutes, then she call me ten time
If mi nuh pick up then she panic then she panic then she call mi friend line
Cause she want the veteran fi come and bend up her spine, a substantial amount of african fly squat

Where savages fought and pastors taught
Prostitutes stomp in high heel boots
And badges screaming,""Young black children stop or I will shoot!""
I look back at cooked crack
Plus cars that pass by
Jaguars mad fly
And I'm guilty for materialism
Blacks is still up in the prison Trust that
So save me your sorries, I'm raising an army
Revolutionary warfare with Damian Marley

welcome-to-jamrock,2005,damian-marley,Hip-Hop,"Welcome to Jamrock, camp whe' the thugs dem camp at
Two pounds a weed inna van bag
It inna your hand bag, your knapsack, it inna your back pack
The smell a give yah girlfriend contact
Some boy noy notice, them only come around like tourist
On the beach with a few club sodas
Bedtime stories, and pose like dem name Chuck Norris
And don't know the real hardcore
Cause Sandals a no 'back-to', da thugs Dem we do what dem got to
And won't think twice to shot you
Don't make dem spot you, unless you carry guns a lot too
A bare tuff things come at you
When Trenchtown man stop laugh and block-off traffic
Then them wheel and pop off and dem start clap it
With the pin file down and it a beat drop it
Police come inna jeep and them can't stop it
Some say them a playboy, a playboy rabbit
Funnyman a get dropped like a bad habit
So nobody pose tuff if you don't have it
Rastafari stands alone!
Welcome to Jamrock, Welcome to Jamrock
Out in the streets, they call it murder!
Welcome to Jamdown, poor people are dead at random
Political violence, can done! Pure ghost and phantom, the youth
Them get blind by stardom
Now the Kings Of Kings a call
Old man to Pickney, so wave only one if you with me
To see the sufferation sick me
Them suit no fit me, to win election them trick we
And them don't do nuttin at all
Come on let's face it, a ghetto education's basic
And most a the youths them waste it
And when them waste it, that's when them take they guns and replace it
Then them don't stand a chance at all
And that's why a nuff little youth have up some fat matic
With the extra magazine inna them back pocket
And have leisure night time inna some black jacket
All who not lock glocks, them a lock rocket
Then will full you up a current like a short circuit
Them a run a roadblock which part the cops block it
And from now till a mornin not stop clock it
If the run outta rounds a brought back ratchet
Welcome to Jamrock (Southside, Northside)
Welcome to Jamrock (East Coast, West Coast, huh, yo)
Welcome to Jamrock (Cornwall, Middlesex and Surry)
Welcome to Jamrock

pimpa-s-paradise,2005,damian-marley,Hip-Hop,"And yes y'all, you now rocking with the best
Black Thought from the legendary Roots crew in the flesh
I split up in here with the brothers from the Marley family
Creston--we gon' say it for y'all
She loves to party, have a good time
She looks so hearty, feeling fine
She loves to smoke, sometimes shifting coke
Hey, she'd be laughing when there ain't no joke
Pimpa's paradise! that's all she was now
Pimpa's paradise! that's all she was
Pimpa's paradise! that's all she was now
Pimpa's paradise! that's all she was
Cause coke was a thing that once she first try
Was once a blue moon to once a blue sky
Now she's wondering who else wants to go buy
She don't got no money and wants to get high
Story sounds familiar,
Like born to be wild but she sillier
Not quite the same, but she similar
A waste of my sarsaparilla
Used to look good in the videos, now she look hideous
Now it's broken crack pipes with lipstick traces
Walks the cold nights red district places
She seen more hotels than my tour suitcases
More male customers than Old Navy's
She love lime light more than John Swaby's
Seen more miles than a Rent-A-Avis
She don't slow down then someday maybe
She lost and can't find her way to safety
Pimpa's paradise! that's all she was now
Pimpa's paradise! that's all she was
Pimpa's paradise! that's all she was now
Pimpa's paradise! that's all she was
Check it out
She keep her head up in the space like a satellite
Because she got an insatiable appetite
For staying out late nights with all the parasites
Plotting on a way to cop a little piece of paradise
Her dignity the only thing that she could sacrifice
Just get the monkey off her back and she'd be back in line
Five minutes she stay on the move,
She'd done smoked up the stone that the builder refused
All coked up alone, she ain't even in tune
And it's sad cause she ain't really have a reason to use
She was pretty girl
Cleaner than the Board of Health
Studied and enjoyed herself, I don't know what drove her to avoid herself
Destroyed herself and took a taste of the yay'
And now she on the track, working while she wasting away
It's safe to say, she looking for a someplace to stay
Who ever got a little paper to play
Can get a slice of this
Pimpa's paradise! that's all she was now
Pimpa's paradise! that's all she was
Pimpa's paradise! that's all she was now
Pimpa's paradise! that's all she was
For no reason a seasoned splif was the first thing
One spring season while she's out flirting
Now she season in and don't need rehearsing
Esteem get a beating, life is uncertain
Ego need feeding, now the wants worsen
Beneath the demons she's a warm person
When she's not fiending, swearing and cursing
Behind the curtains, she's really hurting
And while her people don't even trust her at home
The dealer dem grin and cook the rocks down
And she without sin will spark the first stone
The feeling kicks in she's in the dark zone
Old friends walk pass going 'bout their own
As if she is someone that they don't know
Then the King of Kings lift her off the floor
Saying, ""Life is a thing when you learn you grow.""
Pimpa's paradise! that's all she was now
Pimpa's paradise! that's all she was
Pimpa's paradise! that's all she was now
Pimpa's paradise! that's all she was
She rise and she fall like a star
Her life write off like a car
Her face full of all kinda scar
Always quick fi start a war
She can't keep herself up to par
She plays like a broken guitar
She always want tek it too far
I doubt she a-go mek it too far
She rise and she fall like a star
Her life write off like a car
Her face full of all kinda scar
Always quick fi start a war
She can't keep herself up to par
She plays like a broken guitar
She always want tek it too far
Mi wonder how she mek it so far"

[Chorus: 'Pablo']
Joe Crack's that nigga
I'll crack that nigga, hold THAT lil' nigga

If you know like I know you know you'll get hit with them hollows, sayin
[Fat Joe]
Raindrops are fallin on my hood again, hood again
Niggaz is talkin in the hood again, hood again
Yeah niggaz wanna act live
I got that 9 that kill more than just time
They say they can't stand him, but just yesterday
I was chillin on the block in the Phantom
And ain't nobody smirk my way - nope - keep speakin that hot shit
and you can get merked today, check me out
There's some rumbling on the blocks, struggle on the streets
That's why I had to leave that bitch bloody in them sheets
Go 'head and think Crack just rap
Fuck around I'm gon' really have to clap these cats
I hear 'em talking that
[Chorus]
[Interlude: Fat Joe]
If I don't know you boy I'm lettin 'em go
I tried tell you boy I'm lettin 'em go
Your momma warned you boy that I ain't no joke
I tried tell you boy I'm lettin 'em go
If I don't know you boy I'm lettin 'em go
I tried tell you boy I'm lettin 'em go
Your momma warned you boy that I ain't no joke
I'm tired of talkin boy I'm lettin 'em go
['Pablo']
Does Crack think he live
Just because he had poppin in '88 and his boys served time
I don't care 'bout that neither
I don't give a fuck about him, T.S. or the fever
Yeah I said it, when I see him I'ma pop him
I know he big but this here 9 gon' stop him
I'm in the streets everyday in these projects
I ain't scared nigga, man I'm dyin to get it poppin
[Chorus + Interlude]
[Fat Joe]
Pussies loose these days, gotta tighten 'em up
Think they comin of age 'til you lighten 'em up
Momma screamin cause you lyin in dust, I ain't lyin
Who the fuck you think supplyin the drugs?
I'm your boss that's boss, pretty much I bought you that Porsche
And pretty much I'm 'bout to auction you off
to the highest clapper, get your head spun backwards you bastards
For thinkin Terror Squad just rappers, we'll blast ya
You lil' niggaz ain't even in my lane

I can do u, do u, better, better, better
Than he can, baby, baby
I don't usually do this but I had to push upon you
Excuse if I stutter, d-d-damn, it gets no better
I'm pretty sure you heard it flies no matter the weather
Got a girl, you got a man, this'll be our secret
He plays for the Heat, well, that's so convenient
I'm at the games all the time
While your man runs games, it's a shame how he lies
I can lend a little more than a earful
I know Ma, you're more than a Dior and a hairdo
Yes, furthermore, let me prepare you
Now get it on the floor, ma, don't mean to scare you
But I'ma, punish that then run it back
'Til the sun come up, you screamin' let us crack
Now how you do that? That thing when you do that
Ma, if I could sing, I would whisper to you that
I can do u, do u, better, better, better
Than he can, baby, baby
I can do u, do u, better, better, better

Damn, dammit baby, let me talk to ya
Fly, put your cell back in your purse, let me tell you why
A nigga like me gotta be in your life
Damn, this evening is nice, let me share some advice wit'chall
You're lookin' like you need a reason to smile
You're lookin' kind of, well, lookin' kind of right
Has anyone ever told you you look like Karen White?
Sprinkled with some Beyonce, a little bit of Janet Jackson
Way before them actions, girl, quit actin' like you ain't feelin' me
When you feelin' me, damn, baby, please get up off your knees
And we can flow, we can fly
We can do it, baby
I can do u, do u, better, better, better
Than he can, baby, baby
I can do u, do u, better, better, better
Than he can, baby, baby
What'chu know about your main man Flow Joe?
Chicks say, I resemble that nigga Boss Kojo
And the way I move is, oh, so fly
Ma, take a look in my eyes and just
Watch yourself, yeah, I know them doors swing open awkward
Man, I don't know why they made 'em like that but
Sip some Petron, slip off your clothes
Girl, let's get it on, ma, turn off your phone
'Cause we don't need no interruptions
Hop on your good foot, let's get into somethin'
And don't it feel so right?
Got a T, you can wear for the rest of the night
And we can flow, we can fly
We can do it, baby
I can do u, do u, better, better, better

Go figure it, Joe Crack runnin New York
Who woulda thunk it, God above and Pun did
Yeah, they came while I was 'sleep
Whispered in my ear this is your year {CRACK PREACH!}
So I testify
To burn down the throne, niggaz follow my lead
Save your breath for crownin me King of N.Y.
I'm the one and only Godfather, one through three
Pardon me, but I was raised in the projects
Forgettin I wasn't the only object
We was more concerned with cuttin up and choppin
Supplyin fiends with that work, get it poppin
Now who wanna pop off 'til they head get popped off
By the realest MC, and that's ME!
Joe Crack the Don, I came from the streets
Knee deep in the game, other half in the streets
I got that permit to bury ya ice grill
Shoulda named this album hurr ""Licensed to Kill""
Ahhh - yes my life chilly chill
Mansion in Miami, other in the Jersey Hills
Chillll, that's that '88 flow
Small face 20's, that's that '88 dough

Wonder why I paint a picture of the street life so vivid I lived it
Y'all dudes innocent, y'all just visitin
And that's the reason why they call me ghetto
D.O., have you homeless {?} diggin deep holes
Police know, but just couldn't figure me out
I'm like {?}, have 'em makin pies in the house
It's grill, spit fire like I never been out
And I ain't gon' retire 'til there's never a doubt
The wheels, in my head keep spinnin
I'm thinkin anybody go against me losin chil'ren
I'm thinkin there's no better time than now to start some killin
It's Cook Coke Crack, 2005's ghetto version of Achilles NIGGA

Yo, yo, loop this and you crash the remix
And forget who you thought I was, I'm Crack BEYOTCH
The same dude that made you ""Lean Back""
And had that nigga Ma$e spittin that gangsta shit
Can't wait 'til my nigga Shyne come home
Six minutes, six minutes, Joey Crack you're on
Uh-um, uh-um, is my microphone on? Yes
New York, look I brought the championship home
Now, through up your peace signs to the sky
For all our soldiers that died
That means Biggie Smalls, Tupac, Big L and Left Eye
And Big Pun the greatest of all time, sing it with me now

Good heavens, had to wait for track seven
To adjust them fly dresses and high heel stilettos, yes
This vibe is perfect, I wonder
Maybe that's why four's the God's perfect number

Yo, I know ma, I see your vision
Fuckin with me is like an all-inclusive private island vacation
Woo - room service from the A.M. to the P.M.
All, night crushin this amazin human bein
Got you love struck, topic controversial
Cause when I'm gone you're lost like that Corona commercial
I know time is money still I can't reimburse you girl
For what you wear, that's the day I reverse you girl
You get your nails painted proper
Pull out the black Amex, I'll take you shoppin
But when it's time to go I disappear like Hoffa
I see you next time when I decide to pop up, I'm gone

Niggaz say, that he ain't, but ain't I good?
Got the whole fuckin industry shook; matter fact the streets
Cause all the killers come home clappin for me
Ain't no peace on the streets with these Spanish kids
Just another cop beating in Los Angeles
Yup! You guessed it the President didn't say shit
'Nother vacation, chillin in Camp David
And they wonder why the hood's so hot
My pops locked up, my moms cooked rock
And just the other day Lil' Troy got shot
Over a 2 dollar dice game, way to lose your life mayne

Shaking his ass, what the fuck is wrong with this nigga

Waiting for you niggaz to dunk
Where are all your guns and them teflon vests?

On the streets of the Bronx, that's the county I own

Damn near a decade done passed and we still on top
My nigga Pun died, niggaz thought the shit gon' stop
I'm not concerned with the rumors and the small talk
Thought a nigga learned when he caught it and he walked off
Shoulda put the burn to a nigga so he'd slow down
Niggaz won't be thinkin, that's it rap, when it go down
In L.A. we got Bloods and Crips, in Chi-Town the Kings
Got other mob bosses kissin my ring
Don't confuse me wit'cha favorite MC
Difference is this mans'll kill him as a favor for me
Until then it's just...

We all get money and we all smoke purp'
Hit the dirt one squirt'll leave all ya'll murk
Cause I'm fresh in my white tee, they glance at my white tee
And I got that hat that match my pants and my white tee
Whoever that you might see, I know they got a white tee
Homeboy, brother, sister, mother, daddy or your wifey
Hanes or Fruit of Loom be the name of my white tee
I gotta change man it's a stain on my white tee
Lames in a white tee, I bring the pain in my white tee
Hispanic, cracker, nigga even yangs wearing white tees
Hit the club deep and we all got a white tees
A throwback, no gat, hell naw that don't excite me
You don't need no throwback cause you will be set on your white tee
You can get a circle or a v neck on your white tee
[Hook]
[Verse 2]
Well I hit the mall in my white tee, ohh I think they like me
Or they like them diamonds cause they shine so brightly
Yeah you know how I be up under my tee it's that wifey
Fo'fo' tucked tightly for them niggaz who think I'm soft
Nigga come and try me, they gon' find yo' body
White tees in the club and while we drinking on Bacardi
Fuck throwbacks, white tees in party
Now don't get me started, gotta try record it
Bullshit we avoid it
Everyone wear white tees, cause they can afford it
Girls wear white tees, boys wear white tees
Niggaz in the trap nigga bet they got a white tee
I wear a white tee, you wear a white tee
The next day catch me with a brand new white tee
Ohh that boy there clean, white shoes fresh jeans
But on that boy shirt what it say? Not a thing
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
I gotta couple throwbacks, it's just I choose not to wear 'em
White tee extravaganza nigga like a Foot Locker sale
Niggaz think I done failed, but my paper stackin a lot
Or you can throw-back this, but partner check my knot
And all my ghetto gangstas white tee, laws gone hate ya
With street game and a little fame them hoes gonna chase ya
Can't escape bro, this white done covered the map
Like crack did in the eighties, it took over the trap
Come to the hood you can find me trapping in my white tee
Standing with a full grill niggaz might try me
So high, I bem still in my white tee
Rock jeans tiger green yeah hoes like me
Haters try to bite me, some try to dislike me
Became a rich nigga and the feds try to indict me

But stay focused like ya mind in a chess game
Get to the money that's the only thing that matter mane
Believe in ya dough choose zeroes over hoes mane
Even when ya hurt be a starter not a second string
Produce like troops throw it up like ya serve game
Get ya weight up nigga cuz I'm seein six figures

A MC six screen scatin on 25s

I almost went away
I couldnÃ¢??t tell you all the things

It doesn't matter what you say anymore,
Things you do don't amaze me
so, now I see you like you passed on
Don't nothing last long, shit ain't forever
Whatever you thinkin' of,
there's always something ten times better
Don't mean to bust your bubble, sink your boat
But if you dive in, and can't swim, you ain't gonna float
It's like, some people try as hard as they can
to fit in a situation they don't understand
Confused and fed up and don't know what else to do
Until they get mad enough and come after you
I wanna, take this time to figure out what I'm all about
Should I do 'em in, or just chill and shut my mouth
God forgive me for this evil takin' over
But there's situations I won't understand until I'm older
Gotta, live my life through these twists and turns
And it doesn't matter cause I'm always down to learn
It doesn't matter!
[Chorus 2x]
It doesn't matter if my shotgun splatters your brain
It doesn't matter if I'm bustin' and I got that eighth
It doesn't matter if you murder me, I'll do you the same

Different lifestyle, new face each day
Unplug yo' mind with words I say
No choice don't move, think hard what's next
Didn't respond quick enough, ain't no time left
And if there was it wouldn't matter,
Nothing matters where I'm from
Center of the earth with the worms and scum
Ya don't want none of this bitch, keep on steppin'
All that drama that you bring with your mouth as a weapon
Ain't no one ever told you talkin' shit don't pay
The only thing that you get is the killa in your hallway
Lookin' to revert everything that you said
Turnin' your whole room red, bloody carpet, the bed
I can see a lot clearer now, than where I'm headed
There is no hate, do or die,
To try and keep my head straight
The more you think about me the sadder you're gonna get
But now it's done and over, so I guess it doesn't matter
Bitch!
[Chorus 2x]
It doesn't matter if my shotgun splatters your brain

I know that they don't like and it don't matter none
I'mma keep actin' a fool, reppin' the shotgun
Somebody come and kill me, nothin' else seems to work
Got me jabbin' this pen in my heart for every perk
With my blood on it, I'm bleedin' on the track
You can hear me lose a lung if you listen to the playback
It don't matter, cause nobody's listenin'
I am, start to finish, bitch, peep the manuscripts
Ya see, if where I'm from, from the pigs where we lived
When we buckin' at the precinct and the judge from the jail
Throwin' the hatchet up with ABK and the fam
Rockin' throwbacks Psychopathic, where it all began
It don't matter how I got here or where I come from
I still be standing in the aftermath of devastation
Fuck everybody who don't wanna hear me
Maybe it's what I say and portray is why they fear me
It doesn't matter
[Chorus 2x]

Put your hands up if you're down for the struggle
Cause it's time to push through this rubble
UH!
I got one thing on my mind, willing to grind
both feet on the ladder, and I'm ready to climb
Too many mouths to feed, so you gots to believe

We're droppin' bombs up in this bitch!!
Tell me what's goin' on!?
Ya'll better recognize
Psychopathic
DROPPIN' BOMBS!!!
I will always keep my shit, underneath the surface
Because the way I flow, the mainstream don't deserve this
I'm set out to break backs on tracks,
and scratch on all records that you spin on wax
I'm a crazy motherfucker with pride
And I got enough wisdom to keep my soul alive
So grab a mic and lemme see if it shine
Cause it's time to make this whole world mine, all mine
Everytime I see these people
They always just stop and stare
Like I don't belong in this place
So they say that it's not fair
I can't understand this drama
That the earth brings down on me
So let me take you through my mind
Look in my eyes, follow me
[Chorus 2x]
Tell me
What's going on
and drop these bombs on you
I'm gonna tell you why I'm droppin' bombs
Because I'm sick and fuckin' tired of seeing fire alarms
Little explosions, marshmallows roasting
Soft motherfuckers standing on the stage boasting
Now don't expect me to just walk away
Because I've been told ya'll that I'm here to stay
I'ma still keep flowing, from coast to coast
And I'ma still keep smoking weed with juggalos
I'ma still bust caps, at all these hoes
And I'mma drop me a bomb off, at every show
That's how it is, so just grab your bow
Because it's time to represent
and watch these warriors grow
I can't understand this drama
That the Earth brings down on me
So let me take you through my mind
Look in my eyes, follow me"
charlie-brown,2004,abk,Hip-Hop,"[First Chorus]
Charlie Brown, please, don't come around
Because your weed is doodoo brown
and it smells like the ground
You're still my homie (but no more bammer)
But with that weed you don't know me
When I inhale this, the staleness creeps up on me
I love weed, especially when it gets me gaspin'
Coughin' up a lung from that passion
Graspin' onto life with every hit that I take
When I'm high, is the only time I feel awake
Roll it up, bags on reserve is what I deserve
No joke I gots to smoke cause it calms my nerves
And if Charlie was around I guarantee a tragedy
From his dirt, brown weed means head starts to hurt
Call me a high on, red eyed zombie
smelling like oak with a twist of pine tree
And fuck Smokey, my names Big Inhale
And I'm known to take it down to the tail,
You know what I mean?
Resi-res build up on my fingernail
Clam baked inside the soundproof Lotus Pod cell
Lettin' out, when I'm blessed to give
So, pass it back and let me get another hit
Big Smoker
[Second Chorus]
Charlie, Charlie
Your weed is so sorry (mmm mmm mmmm)
You must have grown it in a dusty safari
I just can't smoke that no mo'
Even though I'm broke and I'm po'
I smell that shit in your bag,
I choke and run for the do'
Don't hate you, Charlie
And homie, you still my boy
Just keep that junk on your spot
(Don't bring it 'round here)
And homie, you still my boy
Cause that I can't never handle
I need to be high
So stay the fuck off my block
and don't come back on my side
Charlie, Charlie (Charlie Brown)
You just ain't fresh anymore
Because I like to be lifted
Your shit grounds me to the floor
Don't make me deck you, Charlie (Bitch)
Don't come 'round with that
Don't nobody want to hit that
Ya'll bustas need to quit that

There's a party goin' on, who's comin' with?
To kill the rest of that warm 40, and grab ya shit
I hope you got some money, cause I ain't got your back
Especially how cheap you was on the chronic sack
There's a party at the liqour store,
don't be claimin' broke
Actin' like a cold 40 ain't good on the throat
Who you think that you foolin'? Cause it sure ain't me
Should'a borrowed five dollars from your old lady
Is there anybody's cup as empty as mine?
Pile into the Hoo-ride, seats recline
Stop at the weedspot, order up another
This is how we do it, MUTHAFUCKA
CD burned full of old school tracks
On the corner of the party store shootin' some craps
If this is something that you normally see
then you probably live close to me
[Chorus]
There was a party at the liquor store
C'mon!
There was a party at the liquor store
C'mon!
There was a party
Anybody!
Party
Everybody!
There was a party at the liquor store
C'mon!
[Colton Grundy]
I showed up, showed up
Khaki's creased
And a chicken head hangin' on either side of me
Sendin' me to the store
To cop some 40s
And I take my time, and make my way around the party
See my boy JD, and the weedspot on wheels
65 Impala, drop top, and make the shit hop
Come on out, sparks the blunt, with two bitches
Then came through the skunk, we got fucked up!
Seconds passed, the chicken heads came back
Now it's off to minglin' and see who else up in the shack
The music started bumpin', there ain't no sign of the pigs
If there was, I'd pull my shit and split they fuckin' wigs
I'm high as fuck, and stumblin' off six 40s
By the time I see my homie, ABK, up at the party
Chillin' with seven hoes and they sell toes
Or they dream about sex and those in birthday clothes
[Chorus]
There was a party at the liquor store
C'mon!
There was a party at the liquor store
C'mon!
There was a party
Anybody!
Party
Everybody!
There was a party at the liquor store
C'mon!
[Anbody Killa]
When I got there, shit was tight
So I rolled up a blunt of that chocolate tie
Everybody was chillin' out front, sayin' ""What's up?""
Walk in to grab a 40 as I spark my stuff
Went straight to the back where the brew be at
Grabbed a cold 4-0 and proceeded to crack
Gotta dollar fifty sub and a bag of Better Made chips
Phone number from the hot bottle return bitch
It was a good day, perfet day to party
Hot bangin' bootyliscious freaks actin' horny
Man, this party store is kinda like the club
Besides the bums comin' in, cause the beer's cheap enough
I was gettin' my groove on, big straight pimpin'
Aisle of the party store, Bud Light sippin'
I heard a gunshot, my drink dropped
I coulda swore it was the fuckin' cops
[Robbery noises]
[Chorus]
There was a robbery at the liquor store
What happened?!
There was a robbery at the liquor store
What happened?!
There was a robbery
A robbery?
Someone got shot
He got shot?!
There was a robbery at the liquor store
What happened?!"

Do I really wanna see so clearly
even though I know bad things might appear
Tell me that it's not a waste of time
To write a rhyme as therapy to try to clear my mind
I was asked this question, not too far back
""Did you ever think that you would be where you at?""
Small child, state of mind, knew I would
plus the sound of the drum from the wind felt good
Place and time, though, it chose me
gave a scrub mad love, now we all family
No backs, never, I won't turn
don't act like my soul ain't concerned
about, if you like me, if you hate me,
when I die, will they take me someone
tell me if I see you all another day
Like I never would be flippin' the script
with these livewire lips that ignite with spit
[Chorus]
I'm writing this as if it was my last
Thank you for the memories and times we had

Remember me as if I never went away
Because I see you all another day

What I'm a..bout to say, some might hate
some might feel, that I'm keepin' it real
if I...drop the steel, and grab the axe
cut down trees just to clear a path
Try to show ya'll wrong from right
a down state of mind means too uptight
Think positive, better opportunities
Red, yellow, black, and white, muhfuckin' unity
You ain't foolin' me, Ain't nobody schoolin' me
Graduated from the streets of Ghetto University
Most people can't deal with this
so quick to grab a pistol cause they too damn pissed

For all the suicidal things I did

Struggling, when things start bubbling
Can't wash away what's not seen
guess we all gotta little dirty history
Eeeny meeny miney moe

Don't know which way to go

down-here,2004,abk,Hip-Hop,"[Anybody Killa]
How ya doin'? It's me again!
Underneath the concrete
Sewage of the underworld, where the fuckin' dead sleep
Creepin' and crawlin' with the stench of a rat
Hear me when I'm comin' but ya don't know where I'm at
Never seen in the daylight, only in the nighttime
Huntin' for me something that can increase my lifeline
I see it all, dead bodies and such
Ghetto gators goin' crazy when they haven't had they lunch
The more I kill, the bigger they get
It's like two Hannibal cannibals and one biscuit
Who's to blame that my parents hated me
And put me in the sewer cause they knew I couldn't reach
Seems like I was there for years
Before I grew a little bigger and I gave em both a scare
Now I'm addicted to payin' people back
Sittin' underneath the sewer caps
and waitin' for you to pass
[Chorus]
Down here
There ain't no light,
Might not be alright
Down here
In these sewers and pipes
It's always night
Down here
There's no sunlight I'm feelin'
Down here
Ya have to crawl and find it all appealin'
Appealin'
[Violent J]
Sometimes the tunnels get so small
I have to army crawl
My way through
Can you relate to that?
I can see up ladies skirts
on their way to work
Just for a second
I see they booty and neden
Tell 'em Killa
[Anybody Killa]
Come and visit us I know it's somewhere that you wanna be
Gettin' dirty life of no luxury
Even though this road is so swervy
This place is still home to me
[Chorus]
Down here
There ain't no light,
Might not be alright
Down here
In these sewers and pipes
It's always night
Down here
There's no sunlight I'm feelin'
Down here
Ya have to crawl and find it all appealin'
Appealin'
[Violent J]
It's always nighttime
In the pipelines
I sit in the sewage waistdeep and write rhymes
I know these sewers
And which ones are the newest
And which ones be some underground transit movers
We like Swamp Thing, down here, damn near
They throw homeless people in, stab 'em,
cook 'em right there
I can dive, roll, somersault, tunnel crawl, spring
I been bitten by so many fuckin' rats it ain't a thing
I love this, I crawl through your housepipes
I'm hiding in your shower nozzle pissin' on your wife
People down here are hungry, they eat muthafuckas
Everybody's alone, they always eatin' each other
I came crawlin' out the toilet, into somebody's john
I walked out and the family started screamin', it was on
I ran for the fridge and grabbed everything I could
And then dove in through the kitchen sink
and back to tha hood
I met a hooker down here, ya think they bad up there
This bitch ain't even have a neden left anywhere
Just a big hole with nothing in the middle
Her ugly ass titties had a rat hangin' and chewin'
off of each nipple
Runnin' through the dark maze, I know my way
I know no days, only glowing rays
Beaming through the sewer hole lids of the streets
Certain parts, but them parts certainly ain't for me
[Chorus]
Down here
There ain't no light,
Might not be alright
Down here
In these sewers and pipes
It's always night
Down here
There's no sunlight I'm feelin'
Down here
Ya have to crawl and find it all appealin'
Appealin'

There's no sunlight

Well ya know, You're gonna have to help me
You know that old building, next to the Indian burial grounds?
Well word has it
There's a chest buried underneath the floor boards under the stairway there
And inside it, there's all type of dirty history
Left behind by this crazy warrior
And people say if it was ever dug up
It would bring this guy back around
Then he would spread all these messages himself
So now that I've told you all
Do you still wanna hear something dirty?
Ok, follow me
Look, there's the stairway
Come on, hurry up, let's pull up these floor boards
Look, there it is, help me pull it up
Quick, give me something to break off this lock
Cool, now help me open it up

Pointin' my heat
Straight get off on bein' the street
I'm puttin'
One little
Two little
Three little holes in the back of ya dome
You shoulda stayed home
D-Town born and raised
Drinkin' on a porch
Beatin' down on strays
Broke as fuck
and always hungry
Clothes on my back be dirty laundry

Just give me a fuckin beat
Just give me a fuckin beat
Those who grip a mic are known as teachers
I'm dusty like a ashtray
I don't give a shit
Got a clean ass piece though
With a full clip
and a small axe underneath the passenger seat
Ready to swing it
Best believe I'mma bring it
Who you think ya messin' with, don't trip
I'm a warrior
Scalpin' all those who ain't standin on the same side
When its all about to go down
Fightin' with the enemy
Puttin' them in the ground
I bring that old school basement sound
When all I had was a forty-five weighin' me down
Little redskin homey in the hood
Big pimpin'
Ghetto fabulous in the booth bullshittin'

laugh-at-you,2004,abk,Hip-Hop,"A mind is a terrible thing to waste
High school reunion wouldn't show my face
I was always looked at a little different
And I got blamed for everything,
even if I ain't do the shit
It was hectic, a total fuckin' nightmare
A room full of preps, and one thug with braided hair
Runnin' through the halls screamin' ""Fuck all ya'll!""
Brass knuckle punch jackin' all jock's jaws
Insane in the cranium, people always starin'
Pointin' at me, laughin' close enough
so I can hear 'em
Until the day that I got my revenge
When they found one student stabbed to death with a pen
Whole school goin' through some emotional stress
Gotta half day off cause of that bullshit
Let me take another victim see if I can get a whole day
Remember that bitch Lisa?
They just found her in the hallway
I ain't playin' no more, stop laughin'
'Cause all that chit-chattin' as got this killa crackin'
Teacher's pet, bullethole in ya chest
Whole football team damn near layed to rest
Half the students missin', and no one knows shit
They haven't got a clue that it was all me, bitch
Higher education learn a little something ya'self
Who's next to be got, not too many left
I'm so glad this year's almost over
And maybe next year, before they laugh,
they'll look over the shoulder
New students comin' in, I'mma still be in the same grade
Murder after murder all the way until I graduate
Crazy killa, crazy killa's what they call me
No evidence, but I'm still the number one suspect
Never once was invited to a party
And if I ever was, all I'd do is bring bloodshed
[Chorus 2x]
They don't like me
They don't want me
Ever since I got here
They treated me strange
They got me going crazy
Ain't nobody feelin' my pain
Shed no more tears
So many years, my head's been clear
But now I understand
to make all those around fear

What's with the self-inflicted pain?
(I can't help it!)
How come everytime I see you around you act strange?
(I can't help it!)
Why do you trip at the sight of a hater?
(I can't help it!)
And then slit they throat with a rusty ass razor?
(I can't help it!)
As I sit back and think 'bout what to do next
I start to reminisce about my life and shit
Like how I came from the streets
Was raised by the streets
That's why I give love and I'll die for the streets
I really can't help how I feel
And I can give two fucks to know how to deal
With the pain and anger, stress, emotions
I just roll a blunt, light it up and start smokin'
Sometimes I feel like I'm losin' it
And start blastin' at phones and shit
That's why I'm fully equipped
with the hollowtip, so bitches don't slip
I can't help all the things I do
(I can't help it!)
I gotta feelin' neither can you

I can't help if I'm crazy, or just insane
I can't help if the words I speak cause pain
Ya gotta..keep ya cool, and say (I CAN'T HELP IT!)
Rearrange, time will change (FUCK IT!!)
Deal with it, face ya'self
I can't help if my mind's taking o-over
Brace ya'self, there's no time left
my soul is gettin' clooo-ser
Stay away if you can't stand the heat
Cause when the mike's off, I'm corruptin' the streets
Brown paper bag wrapped around my drink
Eyes wide open, I can't help to blink
Why do you talk that way?
Say all those things you say
Those rumors you create, I bet you can't help it

What's with the self-inflicted pain?
(I can't help it!)
How come everytime I see you around you act strange?

Why do you trip at the sight of a hater?
(I can't help it!)
And then slit they throat with a rusty ass razor?
(I can't help it!)
I said I couldn't help it, so leave me alone
Why you askin'? Quit harrassin'!
Too paranoid to pick up the phone
Home alone all day dustin' off the chrome
What am I supposed to do?
When everytime I turn around I got to deal with fools
It's like I gotta bend all the rules
to try to take what's mine even if I lose
Why you never make it to work on time?
(I can't help it!)
Why you smoke all the weed if you knew it was mine?
(I can't help it!)
Why you always start shit right before you leave?
(I can't help it!)
I guess fuckin' up comes naturally?

What's with the self-inflicted pain?

How come everytime I see you around you act strange?

You can call us psycho, crazy, insane, with no one to blame

Waitin for the right day to get what we deserve
Like respect from the cops on the curb at the concert
Nice titties, my oh my, but when that tear gas fire

Smoke a blunt blunt in the forest while you piss in the lake

Ain't nothin holdin me back now, holding me back now!

Don't stop, don't let no one hold you
Back from what you really wanna do
Besides in this life all you got is you
Keep your mind clear (Keep your mind clear)
Don't let go...go...go... So emotional
Believe me...I know!!
[Chorus]
Oh no! Oh, oh oh oh no!
Ain't nothin holdin me back now, holding me back now!
Oh no! Oh, oh oh oh no!
Ain't nothin holdin me back now, holding me back now!
You can't hold me back, because I'm comin' full throttle
Hand on my hatchet, who wanna see a head bobble?
I see my streets, like it's a native warfield
And I'm the only red-skin left, standing with no shield
So I started to chop cause I can't stop
Its looking too peaceful up there on the top
So I'm, doing everything that I must
Even if I gotta bust on the ones I can't trust
Ain't nothing hold me back!
Ain't nothing stopping me from takin whats mine!
(You Can't Stop Me! You Can't Stop Me! You Can't Stop Me!)
Ain't nothing hold me back!
Ain't nothing stopping me from takin whats mine!

Stay up off it!

Quit frontin'
Actin' like I don't know what you up to
I see right through you
So what you gonna do?
Never will you step a foot around me again
'Cause hangin' with you I can't win
Some of the people in this world is some straight up hoes
Brown nose, I suppose, that's how it goes
But I sit back watchin', clockin' dollars
With a smirk on my face waitin' for you to holla
So I can say nevehoe, nope, what you thinkin'?
All up in my face, tryna thug, breath stinkin'
You can get the barrel from my homey, Shaggy's shotgun
All up in your face in case ya wanna taste a hot one
I got no love for them marks
Punks, hoes, snitches
Grown ass bitches
So stay away and don't come to close
'Cause you never know who may wanna come and slit ya throat

You ain't gettin' shit

I can't stand a muthafucka like you
When my pockets in mind, I don't care what you into
I got too many mouths to feeds from kids to mothers
My wife and brothers and too many others
See I'm being tryin' to speak on
while you sit back and see me as a jar of Grey Poupon
I should'a just stuck my dick in your mouth
Gave your eyes chocolate donuts and bounced the fuck out
I go home and meditate with some sage
Tryna brush off these forked tongues like back in the day
But your new name is vittle fingers
'Cause your a bank account raper tryin' to steal my dinners
Just another undercover crackhead
It comes down to you ain't rapin' me again
Nevehoe, bitch, for now and nevermore
Just get your hands out my cookie jar you fuckin' whore
[Chorus 4x]
Nevehoe
You ain't gettin' shit
Nevehoe
Nevehoe
Stay up off it!
[Anybody Killa]
Nevehoe, not no mo'
'Cause all your true colors are startin' to show
Greedy ass, hand in the cookie jar
Tryna get a fistful but it's just too hard
Let me catch you again, I thought I said never
Tryna take what's mine but you ain't that clever
Runnin' with a hatchet
Psychopathic
We don't stop, so you gets no cream of our crop

Twelve years in this game, for what?
So you can a bank teller out my butt, BITCH!
Now fuck that, it's time for some chokin'
Crackin' those legs open, 'cause your drunk and smokin'
Spittin' out babies like your spit your game
Shitloads of money in fifteen minutes of fame
Nevehoe, no, I ain't the one
I don't pack one, but I do got a gun

trees-and-woods,2004,abk,Hip-Hop,"You ever chase after Death?
People chase after Death everyday
(Chasing after you, and you never see it coming)
And don't even realize
But watch out, watch out, ya never know when it's gonna
chase after you
(Chasing after you, and you never see it coming)
[Chorus 2x]
I ran through the trees and the woods
chasing after you, chasing after you
(Chasing after you, and you never see it coming)
Bet ya never seen us coming, while you was just chillin'
Overnight sounds so dark and thrillin'
With the quickness
I bring the sickness
Run hurry hurry run
Ya really got to feel this
To the outside we look ungifted
But look deeper into yourself and prove your own existence
Treat me like I'm unfree
When neighborhoods are burnin' down to the third degree
To visualize is my own teepee
Because the hate we try to stop all began with me
Reincarnation, like it or not
But when you at Death's door we gonna see what you got
Standing up on that platform
Mad as hell cause you was never well informed
I guarantee you're gonna wanna come back
With a whole new life that's so compact
[Chorus 2x]
I ran through the trees and the woods
chasing after you, chasing after you
(Chasing after you, and you never see it coming)
I've been chasin' but you couldn't tell
You've been hidin' but I guess you fell
Now, it's something that you gotta deal with
Six feet deep all sleep for you, kid
I can't stop chasin'
Don't know what I'm facin'
Everytime I turn around
I'm chasin' after you
Could this be all I am?
A trapped soul in the shell of a man?
No one would ever understand
But I guess that was the plan
So I guess I'm gonna try and relax
And only lay down straight up facts
Is there anyone out there that sees what I see
Passed on life tryin' to reach me?
[Chorus 2x]
I ran through the trees and the woods
chasing after you, chasing after you
(Chasing after you, and you never see it coming)
Why do we feel how we feel inside?
You ever think about when it's time to die?
Not knowin' when
Not knowin' how
Quittin' like a coward takin' yourself out
Livin' life chasin' after Death
Ya never know how much time is left
Sure glad I can depend on ya'll
Pickin' me up when I start to fall
Never makin' me feel left out
So I swear to the earth I'll never let ya doubt
That I, don't feel the same way inside
Take a good look into a killa's eyes
I'm told everywhere I go
that I'm held cause of my technique
So take ya time, and listen real slow
Cause these words are deep that I speak
Listen up, listen up
[Chorus 2x]
I ran through the trees and the woods
chasing after you, chasing after you
(Chasing after you, and you never see it coming)
And you never seen it coming
And you never seen it coming
And you never seen it coming
Chasing after you
And you never seen it coming
And you never seen it coming
And you never seen it coming
Chasing after you"
hey-yall,2004,abk,Hip-Hop,"Hey ya'll
Come over here, check this out
And gimme a minute of your time, but don't doubt
Anything that I tell ya'll, listen up closely
It's something ghostly, my ancestors told me
Way back before we walked the earth
It was so much cleaner cause it wasn't disturbed
But there was still hatred and strugglin' for our color
Cause if you had nothing you were bound to smother
And I don't know why, cause helping hands should be a must
It was written on the manuscript, in the book you trust
Unless it's all just a way to get us arguin'
Believe what you feel, even if it's a life of sin
[Chorus 2x]
Hey ya'll
Everybody gotta watch they back
We alone, so watch your back
Hey ya'll
Everybody gotta walk in they own path
But at the end, you can't go back
Ever since there's been a jail cell
Murder's been committed
Thou shalt not kill, and who's the one sinnin'?
At the end of all of this, will they be judged?
Punished for the life they took with no grudge
Nowadays, things sure ain't changed
There's a whole lot of states allowed to fry your brains
That's cause lately we just burn it away
Let them build they own prisons where their ass can stay
It's a wonder how we let things happen
I ain't special
But I enjoy takin' it to another level
Bad choices lead to a terrible afterlife
So, just learn your wrongs from right
[Chorus 2x]
Hey ya'll
Everybody gotta watch they back
We alone, so watch your back
Hey ya'll
Everybody gotta walk in they own path
But at the end, you can't go back
Hey ya'll
I don't mean to get ya thinkin' about
Things that's gonna get ya down and out
There just things I had to get up off my chest
Cause I'm trying to relax and just do my best
I don't wanna take a situation, and turn it upside down
I just feel this world's fuckin' around
I mean, who am I to judge?
I just, I was raised to be strong enough
Hey ya'll
Do you understand what I'm saying?
Hey ya'll
My ancestors got me down on my knees prayin'
Hey ya'll
They keep tellin' me to spread the word
Hey ya'll
Cause when they come their gonna test what you have learned
[Chorus 2x]
Hey ya'll
Everybody gotta watch they back
We alone, so watch your back
Hey ya'll
Everybody gotta walk in they own path
But at the end, you can't go back
Hey ya'll
Hey ya'll!

Oh, It's real out here like no one understands sometimes
People can really see what's going on
Like people are just, just going mad infront of me, you get me
Everyone's growing up too fast, I swear
Feds don't understand us, adults don't understand us
No one understands us
We just live do what we do like, It's real
It's raskit, shout out to all the mad dem
Yo, I'm repping I'm trying listen, Yo
[Verse - 1]
Sometimes I wake up wishing I could sleep for ever
I spend my whole life tryna' pull myself together
Tryna' reassure myself that I ain't going mad
I've gotta come to a conclusion it's now or never
Sometimes I wake up wishing I could sleep for years
I've been through anger pain blood sweat and tears
You think that any kid in my position would be glad
Its quite the opposite more worries more fears
Sometimes I wake up wishing I could sleep for days
It's like I've lost the love I'm only in it cause it pays
I find myself back on road things are getting bad
More and more I'm going back to my old ways
Sometimes I wake up wishing I could sleep for good
And if I had the guts to end it all believe I would
It's getting boring always being miserable and sad
Shit I would love to be polite I really wish I could
But lifes pressures often get me down
Sometimes I feel there's not a lot to smile about so I frown
And I talk a big whole heap of badness
Because my life's a big whole heap of madness
I've seen a lot maybe more than I can take
Under pressure everyday trying not to brake
But I'll survive cause it's what I do best
I'm a challenger put me to the test
[Chorus - 2X]
Sleep tight everything will be alright
By the end of the night, will be the day, just
Pray that you see, strong you got a be it
If you want to get through it, stretch your mind to the limit
You can do it
[Verse - 2]
It's almost like I've got no world on my shoulder sometimes
Yo I struggle sometimes, you know I'm hating petty crimes
But we live in hard times
No one to turn to and no one to talk to
Life's like a door way everybody walk through
Everybody's talking but nobody's listening
Everyday some new shit, week out and week in
All this negativity, why you tryna get at me
All up in my life rahhh, where do you get the energy
I don't feel well, but you still bother me
Your giving me a headache man you might aswell just clobber me
Blud lately I've been lonely, but you only fone me
When you want a favour then you wonder why I'm moany
Don't really ask much so I don't own much
Don't receive a lot of love, so I don't show much
But that little that I do I put it in a song for you
Handle your business cause I do, listen"

Because if you ain't chatting about what's happening
Where you living, what you talking about

And you know what it's gonna be an even hotter winter
And I ain't even talking about the whether
Dizzee Rascal, uh
[Verse - 1]
Looks like I'm losing friends there's a lot of hostility in my endz
We used to argue always make enemy friends
Now we settle disagreements with the skenz
Looks like I'm losing mates there's a lot hostility near my gates
We used to fight with kids from other estates
Nine eight millimetres settle debates
Looks like I'm losing site cause I'm looking at the future it ain't bright
So I look out my window and pray every night
I thank God for my friends but they ain't tight
Looks like I'm losing hope cause I climb this mountain without rope
But I know I'm the captain of my boat so I steadily sail and hope not to float
[Chorus]
But it's a brand new day, new opportunities what can I say
I plan to make my pay but put some away for a off key day
But it's a brand new day, new opportunities what can I say
I plan to make my pay but put some away for a off key day
Demand collect, cash up front and direct
Pay money pay respect don't insult my intellect
Demand collect, cash up front and direct
Pay money pay respect don't insult my intellect
[Verse - 2]
When we ain't kids no more will it still be about what it is right now
Like fighting for anything anytime and acting without a care and where
And when we ain't kids no more will it still be about what it is right now
Like bank scams, street robbery, shotters plotters or H.M.P
And when we ain't kids no more will it still be about what it is right now
Pregnant girls who think they love useless mans with no plans
And when we ain't kids no more will it still be about what it is right now
Cause negative signs just keep showing up
Some of us beter just start growing up

But it's a brand new day, new opportunities what can I say
I plan to make my pay but put some away for a off key day
But it's a brand new day, new opportunities what can I say

Pay money pay respect don't insult my intellect
Demand collect, cash up front and direct

[Verse - 3]
When I look at my life I can't help but think
Cause I could of resulted to drugs and drink
Everyday was the same as the day before
But we where never quite sure of what's in store
Every day I wake up I can't help but feel
I'm certain of life I mean this is real
Mad thoughts skip around my head like dance themes
I know it's long to question but I need answers
The who's, the what's, the how's, the when's, the why's
You can at look in my face and see the pain in my eyes
Tears ready to fall like the rain in the skies
So hold back put my feet down and rise
Cause guys want to test my words
So I can't just cater for second or third
Plus I know predators only go for the weak
And that's long so I gotta stay strong, you get me
[Chorus]
But it's a brand new day, new opportunities what can I say
I plan to make my pay but put some away for a off key day
But it's a brand new day, new opportunities what can I say

showtime,2004,dizzee-rascal,Hip-Hop,"we grew up in the ghetto where summertimes short
straight action, you don't stop for a fool
most use crime as a way to pay the bills
the un-lucky ones end up gettin caught
we grew up in the ghetto where the growing gets rough
moneys been around but its never been enough
most ain't givin no choice but to hussle
some break down when the going gets tough
deep in the manners all kinds of different people
mines over east still struggle to be equal
so many characters, 4 main types
the good, the bad, the ugly, and the evil
deep in the manner where the povertys visible
there's not a lot sweet so most look misarable
most cave in to the devil, took the wrong puff
son kick the face but still pray for a miracle
soccastars emerge from the curb
up n coming mcs struggle to be heard
boy.... the next jailbird ??
*censored*s talk murder and they live by there word
shotters keep the money going round
kids goin stray most never get found
iv noticed there a ghetto in every town
the skies are empty because the stars are on the ground
(chorus)
we grew up in the ghetto saw real life pain
real life struggle with real life strain
real life kiddies with real life guns
and real life mothers lose real life sons
gang wars are ruftin on the darf flur on the seeser ??
beef after beef just to be the top geezer
big arms gas, the stratford recs
ghetto high murders gotta maintain reps
what's it all about i ask myself before i swing
more time I'm beefin over any little thing
beefin any area,region or vincity
my ghetto frame of mind makes me prone to hostility
to my bredrons locked up, to my young baby mothers
each and every creed and colour, ghetto sisters and brothers
if you know your from the slums keep reppin no doubt
stay ghetto if you must just remember to get out"

I'm looking in to space while my CD plays
I gaze quite a lot, in fact I gaze always
And if I blaze, then I just gaze always my days

And it's the same old story, ninja bikes, gun fights and scary nights
And it's the same old story, window tints and gloves for finger prints

I'm sitting here depressed and I don't know why

And it's the same old story, police don't give me no peace
Yeah, it's the same old story, friends slowly drifting from the ends
Yeah, it's the same old story, I've sussed, there's nobody I can trust

It was only yesterday, it was all love back then

My bredrin's saw him tryin' on tracksuits in soho
I'm buyin' jackets from Benenni in LA
I heard he went to broadway
Limo drive him through Queens
Is he livin' out his dream is he ballin' be truthful
'Cause he ain't sittin' on da wall like he used to
He was on a far tip at one point
He used to peel on Volvo to take da flows to Bethal Green
Next thing I hear him on da pirate radio scene
He used to do deja writ an evil flavour
Bought records off target and mix an a-Dub
Then worked his way to A list
It's funny cause da older's used to dismiss
Dey never for a second anticipated this
Not guts no glory
Dillan took a risk took da piss now
Fella's want to act nigga
If I reminisce on days when Dillan weren't all so crystal
Dey know Dillan put da game on a twist and
Dillan's on a hype now!!!
Worldwide interviews and business trips
Invitations to premiers and new flicks
And all da chicks got his name on their lips
But couple gunman kinda got him on da brain
And also da couples want to put him on frame
Dey're constantly watchin' so he better maintain
But he's getting' major money so he can't complain!

Let's talk about over-excited brehs on the road,
Who brake all street honourary codes,
Can't get a real name for themselves,
Living off reflected glory,
Living off face
Said he knows slimzee ,maxwell, gods gift, said he knows plake, said he knows ace.
Claims he's tight wiv mega man, cool with romeo cousin of kaish,
Said he knows neeko breder hypes, said he had lunch at lethals place
Backstage with the nasty crew
I ask them to get out of my face,
He looks at my face,
I look for a way to move him clear from out of my face
But I leave him there
Hope to the face receiving air
Get a (light) late night phone call,
Pissed 'cause' it's one past business hours
And the clocked this number don't look local
This is why I don't answer the phone
Twenty missed calls in total,
Plus 8 voicemails and about 14 text messages
People can't take hints and messages,
And the message is leave me alone
People got a problem,
(act like) I can make (dubplates) for them,
So they can look (good and tell tales)
Its all jiggy and we look like pals
So I can be the next big star in their phonebook
You look like the real top bois when the
Gyals look big bow capital front, ?

So many faithful stars I've got to deal with
Smiling just for the sake of god knows what
They think or wonder what prognosis they link to my global interest
I guess
Any place where they're not,
Can I get a little space or what?
All complaints aside because I appreciate my love
I know you feel the vibe,
I understand what it takes to swallow your pride
And give a boy ratings and (props)
But I believe that's where it stops,
Maybe a hug or a cuddle (at tops)
But please don't congregate all around me

On the go like no other
Looks like wifey material but she's a ho undercover
She ain't the type of girl you should take home to your mother
You (twanged her) banged her now you're almost certain that you love her
she's known for that that disease moves through nearly all the mcs
High for the hype, in it for the face) blatently off your cheese,

get-by-featvanya,2004,dizzee-rascal,Hip-Hop,"we grew up in the ghetto where summertimes short
straight action, you don't stop for a fool
most use crime as a way to pay the bills
the un-lucky ones end up gettin caught
we grew up in the ghetto where the growing gets rough
moneys been around but its never been enough
most ain't givin no choice but to hussle
some break down when the going gets tough
deep in the manners all kinds of different people
mines over east still struggle to be equal
so many characters, 4 main types
the good, the bad, the ugly, and the evil
deep in the manner where the povertys visible
there's not a lot sweet so most look misarable
most cave in to the devil, took the wrong puff
son kick the face but still pray for a miracle
soccastars emerge from the curb
up n coming mcs struggle to be heard
boy.... the next jailbird ??
*censored*s talk murder and they live by there word
shotters keep the money going round
kids goin stray most never get found
iv noticed there a ghetto in every town
the skies are empty because the stars are on the ground
(chorus)
we grew up in the ghetto saw real life pain
real life struggle with real life strain
real life kiddies with real life guns
and real life mothers lose real life sons
gang wars are ruftin on the darf flur on the seeser ??
beef after beef just to be the top geezer
big arms gas, the stratford recs
ghetto high murders gotta maintain reps
what's it all about i ask myself before i swing
more time I'm beefin over any little thing
beefin any area,region or vincity
my ghetto frame of mind makes me prone to hostility
to my bredrons locked up, to my young baby mothers
each and every creed and colour, ghetto sisters and brothers
if you know your from the slums keep reppin no doubt
stay ghetto if you must just remember to get out"
everywhere,2004,dizzee-rascal,Hip-Hop,"I ain't on a hype ting (Nah!!)

And even though you know I don't mind fightin'

I ain't rampin'
Gota get that dow!
Damm right
Gota get that dow!
I ain't rampin'
Gota get that dow!
Straight up!
Hot taste, charisma style we got plenty
Cruising' in the Porsche I want to to Bentley
Evidently far from gently eatin' up da road
We act immaturely in a hurry to be old
In fact we'll leave you poorly catch a beatin' like a cold
Go ahead profile and flex like you're big, bad and bold
Go ahead go round your next to get hit, had and showed
Stay out the paper chase
Floppy fella's fold
Neglect da rules, expect da codes, follow the guide lines
Life's been ugly so far but these are fine times
I write below the belt I bust average fine rhymes
I always want to be a star my city or the sands
I try not to be stupid with my fame
But constantly I sense fassies bein' clever wiv my name
Indirectly call my name like they're callin' my bluff
So sadly I often sense the need to get rough.
I'm here, there, I'm everywhere

Deal wiv how bad it is
Reminisce, reflect, revise on how bad it coulda been
Abuse time and find out how mad it is
Time waits for nobody handle your biz
Extortionists would love to man-handle this
I'm ignorant, refuse to understand what extortion is
Jack me and get what? Jack me and get where?
Get zilch times zero, times nofin' plus air!
Yea I'm way beyond care
Hate me or love me try not to stare
Your thoughts and your opinions try not to share
I show interest on an occasion that is rare
Plus I ain't in the hype, I'm above it and I cause it
Can't put a stop to da track but I compose it
So play your role
Act tuff put on your show
I'll let da ratchet be your audience
Bullets will applaud it!

My spreaders talkin' gangsta don't know what a gangsta is
(Tut) They ain't ready yet, I don't claim a set
But if you test I'll leave you wiv something you will regret
I'm fat and slim, chocolate skin
I'll punch you in your nostrils, I'll punch you in your chin
But I ain't mad I'm a lovely lad
I'll give you the loveliest beatin' that you've ever had
Rude boy, home boy better chill
You know I don't watch no face cause I'm real
I don't care if your sick I don't care if your I'll
My foot will add a nice frill to your ice-grill!
Son dun-duddy I don't find shit funny

I get on down rolling deep
I've heard the gossip from the street to the slammer
They're trying to see if Dizzee stays true to his grammar
Being a celebrity don't mean shit to me
Fuck the glitz and glamor
Hit em with the Blitz and Hammer
Because they're talking bout rushing
Talk behind my back but to my face they say nothing
Stand up in the dance, keep a firm steady stance
Keep the beanies touching, keep the beanies hot flushing
Flushing MC's down the loo
If you don't believe me bring your posse, bring your crew
Feel free to hate cos I ain't tryna be your mate
Be serious, you wouldn't last an hour in my shoe

More destructive and troublesome than ever

Fellas wanna stop me they'll probably come together
Its probable they'll stop me, probably never
Yo topboy, topman, or top a topper
Come to me with an attitude, come a cropper
I'm old school like Happy Shopper
I fight old school, bring your bat and your chopper
And a First Aid kit and some antiseptic, this could get hectic

She used to love him, he used to love her, she used to kiss him, he used to hug her, call it
Deep love or puppy love, they bunked off school.
Now there's no flame, things ain't the same,
Look's like she's change, thinks it's some game, he's left in the rain, trying to point blame,
Talks for a fool.
She moved on quick, he's still love sick, she's not having it, thinks he's some prick, he won't
Believe it, wants it just how it was in school.
He keeps calling, night or morning, break of evening, break of dawning.
He keeps ringing up, she
Keeps hanging up, oh what a fool.
She is the best friend, of a ex girlfriend, of a old school friend, who is the close friend, of
This best friend, best friend likes this boy called BLUE.
Best friend loves him, best friend needs him, but the ex girlfriend, of the old school friend,
Who is the close friend, of this best friend, likes him too.
So the ex girlfriend, of the old school friend, who is the close friend, of this best friend,
Sits with best friend, who by now has slept with BLUE.
Now the ex girlfriend don't want to pretend that she ain't slept with that boy blue, coz we was a

respect-me,2004,dizzee-rascal,Hip-Hop,"you people respect me, if it kills you x4
do it how they didn't want to do it now they want to try and do it but I'm tellin them no
I'm in a predicament with imitators want to take my style and other bit of my flow
all this copy cattin on my lyrics that ya chattin betta stop until the gunshot's blow
do you really want it coz i really want to give it if you do just let me know
i show arrogance and elegance
but no tolerance for nonsense
i bring violence I'm a nuisance
killer M-see leave no evidence
I've got brains and intelligence
but no conscience no innocence
we roll in the darkened silence
represent us in any residence
and i swing for your chin with no hesitense
imma captain ya betta bring your regiments
and your a failure don't have no relevance
imma champion and a victor prick ya
so not ready so til ya see ya soul
headed for the golden gates
no really you monkeys are playin with hate
not guerilla warfare it's the coppers i carry this stick for
plus I've had enough of these
lil cheek comin from fake M-see's
bad minders and sket ladies
talkin about how it used to be
well it's a brand new day
so leave me be
i don't need you so don't need me
your opinion don't interest me
don't like me that's fine by me
coz from holly street to hollywood its all good
from new york ta your cool its all cool
your a fool if ya think i'm gonna cease
now honestly could there really be peace
it don't seem that way to tough
stop with the games i play to rough
must be smokin to much puff
divert or be deceased
u.k rapper stabbed in nappa
cause of gossip cause of chatter
he's still breathin he's still a dapper
retaliate with gun clapper
truthfully i can't see very well
don't flatter your self your any girl
them boy's shoulda said need ta hell
now prepare for the beast
you people gonna respect me
better make you respect me x4
you people are gonna respect me if it kills you x2
(alright verse two i swear)
endless speculation I'm facin
constant controversial relations
to gun crime at garage events
with so many claims and no evidence
suggesting I'm the reason
for the UK gun clap season
I'm legal may i stress
to the fool for the sake of
strident intelligence
go ahead check my files all day
bit of criminal damage and T-D-A
might be a little bit of violent disorder
but i ain't never been locked away

Yo If that girl know's where you stay that's poor

pregnant? what're you talking about this for
fifteen, she's underage that's raw
and against law 5 years or more
and she wants a score and half of a draw
some kind of friend that you try and ignore
that whore got you pinned down to the floor
but its your own fault you said three magic words (i love you)
when that's the one for the birds
when you said that she forgot other boys
its over you better start buying the toys
there was no intention in front of your wife
that she knows this that she's ending your life
its a real shame you got hacked by the whores
its a real shame that kid probably ain't yours

Take away your joy
Knock knock who's there? Jack

Point me to the sun
Watch your fassy run
I'm dizzee ras nightmare from the big E A S T
I'm exactly what your parent don't want to see on your tv
I nicely, precisely intimadate anyone that I choose
Refuse to to lose
Express unlimited contriversial views
Your average boy or girl on the street might be familiar with my beat
And/or familiar with my sound, I'm formerly from the underground
And its clear, for a year, I've been turing up the heat
Made you get up and out of your seat
Shake your fists and shuffle your feet
And now I'm here
Lets make another thing clear [Overlaps here on previous line]
They didn't bun me up enough I'm still here
So what was the perpose of your little charade, your little charade was whack
Just about hurt me
You should of merked me
I was on a rampage now I'm back
Five stab wounds
Couple scratches, bruises and some pains
Four half-hearted fassies
Four poor is no brains
Did it
Two weeks before my album came out helped me sell double
But lets not dwell on that, its the least of your troubles
[Chorus]
Eh yo considering
The part I play, you wouldn't expect for me me to say I prefer the day to nights where I gotta
turn up and play
I rip-off, dusty, sweaty, clotter raised
And the audience, all screw faced, and promoters don't want to pay
And half of the boys in the croud want to blast me
And half of the girls want to show how little they care about standing right there at the front,
tryin t? look right past me
It gets depressing thinking bout it even more
Knowing that I'm gonna face the usual hassle at the door
Because as well as lippy hags, I hate cocky bouncers
I ain't here to rave I'm here to get paid look
You search me up rough like I'm any common crook
My names on the flyer man, forget the guest book
Abusing your athority you look like a fool
You faulty standard, underdog, you know your own tool
I ain't wearin certain shoes so you don't think I look right (what?)
that's cushdy mate, I'm gettin paid more than you tonight

And now I retaliate with force

dream,2004,dizzee-rascal,Hip-Hop,"I'm not gunna pull this off man without signing the dots
This is too sensible for me man
How you gunna have a dream come true ?
[verse 1]
I used to dream about crazy little things like fame
In the days hanging outside the off licence
We used to run around the steets reckless with no shame
Mainly up to no good the whole world would ask us
And when the girls would walk by we would try to catch their eye
And if they didn't show face we would act immature
Had a thing for south and hackney girls since I was a kid
A couple of west girls on my radar I was raw
And I was dead sure that I knew it all
The whole world got my attitude I nearly blew it all
I find it a real big struggle gettin through ot all
I swear I didn't want to listen cause I sure didn't care
Not knowing for reality that I'd have to prepare
'cause money don't grow on no stick, well it's rare
Me and boy was still looking less and less the lick
Plus I was growing up, life was looking as a scare
[chorus]
I like the talky talky happy talk
Talk about things you like to do
You got to have a dream
If you don't have a dream
How you gunna have a dream come true
[verse 2]
I used to love music it was like my hidden hobbie
But I couldn't get on on local radio back then
So I went to north london and trot to tottenham to be precise
And got some air time on heat fm
And then it esculated I was getting ratings here and there
And carried on until eventually I was everywhere
I started doing all the hot spots ministry ceasers palace p area taminin v
I did the grim and the glam
I done the poor and the posh
I didn't hang around I wanted my money in a rush
Mind frame in the studio at this stage
No time to chat I didn't want to n-gage
I found myself a new hustle it was beautiful
A none like the one before a bit more suitable
The more challenging it got the more I thought it
Made an album over 100,000 people bought it
Thank you
[chorus]
[verse 3]
To all the youngers cotchin on the staires in the flats
With the superstar sockalings Beckham in the making
You can go far if you put your mind to it
Your a star, don't wait to be told, just do it
Try to keep school in your plans don't be worrying about your mans
They'll be there in the end if they're real, if they ain't
don't be making no effort to impress
cause you'll find out where you are just do what you feel
Young babymother I got your back aswell
Young babyfathers hold it down for your girl
I ain't trying to preach but for what it's worth
Back is the next generation planet earth
Big shout to the world cause I've been all around
And when I'm gone I'm always thinking about my home town
I'm from the LDN there's no forgetting that
And the big UK I stay reppin that
[chorus]
You love that
You tell me you don't love that"
imagine,2004,dizzee-rascal,Hip-Hop,"Imagine if I showed you one day I was leaving the hood
Would you call me a sellout? Would you say it's all good?
Would you follow if you could?
Or would you just tell me get the hell out?
And imagine if I showed you that I found another way
of getting dough without doing dirt-- let's blurt
Would you love me for giving me some hope
Or resent me 'cause your pride got hurt?
Imagine if we never grew up on a council estate
And was country manor raised with a spoon in our mouth
Would we still be making fuss about the East and the South
Would we shiver at the robberies, murder and the crack
And thank god that we didn't have to live like that
Just the image on the TV as we're comfortably sat
Sipping wine, room lit by the summer sunshine
Not a worry in the world as we casually chat
Oblivious to how we would be living on the flipside
No experience, not a clue about a rough ride
No harassment, no boy dem (?) on our backside
That would be *amazing*, still
I know you wonder would make you any less real?
What's the corresponding standing in (?), offering
If you had a better offer would you go for the kill?
Snap out of your daydream, how do you feel?
Does it all seem worthwhile for ya?
Try and put it in perspective
Retrospective of your profile and your honor
Do you want to hang about, or are you a goner?
Come along, think fast, decision time
You've been living in the grime, don't you want to climb?
The ladder of life, the wall of enlightenment
Or are you looking for the hype and excitement?
'cause with so much drama in the LDN
It's kind of hard to find legal money to spend
Generation genocide looks possible
The rate at which we draw for this game and pretend
But we don't know who the real enemy is
Who should be held responsible, instead we defend
A couple square meters of pavement, in the end
What will be achieved my friends?"
jezebel,2004,dizzee-rascal,Hip-Hop,"Yo, look, look, look
They call her Jezebel
You might find her in your neigbourhood
Always in some shit
Up to no good
Constant boasting, bragging to her friends
Juiced every boy in the ends
Gettin' outta school
She would truant every day
Always on the link
Different boy every day
Missed mathematics, she was doing acrobatics
But not gym class
She was gettin' doggy fast
Yo, they call her Jezebel
Friends call her sket behind her back
She never knew the plot
She was born of track
Tight top, short skirt, thinks she's too nice
Hates love but she's been deep in twice
Pass with, ho's can't keep her legs closed
Always on the creep
Now she's in too deep
Now she faces neglect, abuse and rape
Man said that he'd kill her if she tried to escape
[Chorus]
What's your name?
I've seen you about
I think your tromp (Boom ting)
I really hope your not a grim
I really hope your not a jezzy, jezzy
Where you from?
Hot stuff (Buff ting)
I really hope your not a grim
I really hope your not a jezzy, jezzy
I've seen you around
I think your tromp (Boom ting)
I really hope your not a grim
I really hope your not a jezzy, jezzy
I know your face
Where you from?
Hot stuff (Boom ting)
I really hope your not grim
I really hope your not a jezebel
You might find her at a house rave
For the fifth time
She's gettin' whammed from behind
Had a bit to drink
So she's acting kinda slow
She came with Natasha
But she's leavin with Joe
Ricky loves jezzy but jezzy loves willy
Ricky means well but Ricky ain't got a thing
Joe's got a name
And jezzy loves fame
She wants a man to show
So it's all about Joe
They call her jezebel
On her way to get wocked out
Get battery
And get kicked out
Jezzy weren't expecting more then four
But what could she say
She just did it anyway
Messed up, caught a kinda STD
Gonorrhoea, Herpes, No VD
Left bitter, left angry, left vexed
But still loves sex
Passed it on to the next
[Chorus]
Pretty but
Ain't got a brain
Got no shame
Got juiced on the train
Went from daddy's little girl
To daddy's heart attack
House reck a side
She could never go back
Raised in the church
Not knowing anything
Then, Learned about boys
Ruined everything
Aged 16
She was never full grown
She was in a family
Now she's got one of her own
Two kids
Even worse
Two little girls
Two more of her
That's two jezebel's
Two fatherless kids
One single mum
No longer young
But the boys still come
Yo, wishin' she could take it back to the old school
And make better choice's
Oh what a fool
Bottle by her side
She wonder man
If only she was six years younger
Damn"

Screw face means I jus want to walk not talk
Screw face means I jus want to leave
When I act off, ain't my screw face, gimme space
Screw face means let me breathe!
I got sick flows
Make an MC have to walk on his tip-toes
Life ain't always nice
That's hoe shit goes
You know we're goin on black
Cause we're black crows
And I can't be seen wit these sick hoes
We're bustin us mic till your chick goes
You are not, not gonna be
Till we kick toes
Your girl's the same as all
Bimbo's, freak's and nimpho's
I got an idea, make dough on the spot
I mean right here
Lock your girls up in for da whole year
You can bring drama cause I don't know fear
I'm violent, feels so clear
Move to the mic Mc's are like oh dear
Some try catchin me but they're not nere
Not ever, not now, or not here way too hot here

Look, yo girls, ladies

flyin,2004,dizzee-rascal,Hip-Hop,"Yeah
What up man, what are ya this week?
He thinks he's rough, and he's always got a screw-face
He's stush and he thinks he's heavy
I've heard, I've heard it all man
Same thing, same shit
I can't believe it
I'm just being me
I work... I'm not doing 'cause I got the money or 'cause I'm famous
This is what I was, you get me?
[Dizzee Rascal]
You can say I'm too rude, you can say I think I'm heavy
You can say I think I'm all that, I've heard it all already
You can say I think I'm rough, you can say you can't wait
Till the day you meet me face to face and swear to set me straight
You can say I sideswipe, you can say I'm overrated
You can slag me off to every female I've ever dated
You can say I'm kinda meek, you can say I'm just a prick
Just say you what you want and what you will but say it quick
[Chorus: repeat 2X]
'cause I'm flyin, I ain't got time
You must makin moves, why you watchin mine?
You got so much to say about my grime
You must be UP THERE, I see you up there
[Dizzee Rascal]
You can I'm arrogant, you should probably say I'm vain
You can say my head swole since I see a little fame
You can say I left the hood, my success was a mistake
You can say I'm under pressure, you can say I'm bound to break
You can never say I'm fake, 'cause I always keep it real
You can say ""so wot?"" I can say ""so chill""
You can say I'm too cheeky, you can say I make you sick
Just say what you want and what you will but say it quick
[Chorus]
[Dizzee Rascal]
Fellas acting bitchy lately quite unsurprisingly
They would love to cut my face but they just cock their eyes at me
Like little ladies would you wish you could express yourself
But violent silences from ya, stops ya so keep your feelings stealth
And wondering if I'm gonna laugh I'm saying don't worry
I weren't invited here, I ain't leavin in a hurry
So any preconceptions that you've got of me, forget them
Please don't let em, confuse you-- I'm gully
And rude, and blatant, no time, in a hurry, impatient
Don't make no more inquiries, fuck you is my only statement
The only answer I'm about to give you:
Fuck you and whoever came with you
Fuck them and anybody related, fuck if I get me frustrated
'cause I ain't the type to hype and rare
Hope I scare em, make 'em fear me
I'm pretty certain you're not near me
There's no need for that
I'm taking time, away from the ? and ? and grime serious grime
Leave the microphone alone, strap and spray some verses with the 9
[Chorus]

Rasci... won't change for no one, ever
I'm me, I've been me
Dapper, rapper, jacker, whateva
I don't play, swear to you"

Six foot deep you can never climb out,
I smoke dat weed till my mum finds out,
Front, back, outside, in
Bear folk kids sipping on jing-sing
Love making not doggy styling
In a dark park, when the dark in being

I'm a baller you've been chucked I'm the kind of kid you can't protect ya know
Out n about I put my elbow in your mouth
You're a fassy there's no doubt
I bet my sword will make you shout
I'm intense you best see sense I'll have you hangin' from a fence
Then I'll laugh at your expense and maybe chuck you 50 pence
Snitch you make me switch you sound and look just like a bitch
Whether you're poor or whether you're rich I'll leave you lyin' in the ditch
Cause I'm from ragged raggo rags you wear raggo rags like me
I'm ahead boy I ain't in tune rappin' raggo rapidly

I'm academically perverse

Batty crew mc's get academically diverted

Come to the man n get pill
Come to the man n get shot
Come to the man n get killed

If you can't back that armsouse who the fuck are you
We call it armsouse, armsouse go n get your firm
If they don't want to listen then we better make em learn
Raised in the gutter I was told I should fight
I create and cause confusion from the left to the right
I'm sweet as a nut, I'm doin' alright, cosy n comfortable
Still I try n avoid the sergeant, p.c and the constable
Raised in the gutter I was told I should bop
I create and cause confusion from the bottom to the top
I doin' o.k, I will honestly say this year I'm flyin' through
I could easily find myself in jail but I ain't tryin' to
I keep it clear in front, relax wid the pressure,
I'm dirty, and I'm stank but ain't nobody fresher
My haters make enquiries, make it obvious they care
When it comes to my location they would love to be aware
But I could be in the manor, could be overseas, could well be definiteley making peace
Could be live at Wembley warmin' up for jay-z
Still I'm definitely certain that you can't see me"

Slicing your wrists
Think you'll ever leave me for her
Revenge is sweet but I

I want you dead
I want you dead
I want you dead
Used to love me and hug me and tell me you need me
Hold me gently, I was sure of everything

Gagging, boxed up, full of maggots
Rotten bones in a wooden casket

Bet all ya'll folks won't admit it but they wanna get in
If you wanna get wit it, we ghetto superstar
I was at the party and the guys spiked the punch
And oh my God, it was like so crazy, I got drunk
I was on the floor and my legs were open and oh my God
Things just happened and I was like the queen of the prom
And everybody loved me and they called me a whore though
But I was like oh my God, I didn't mean it
You know my legs were open, it just seemed to happen
And like don't laugh at me because I'm not a ditsie girl
I am very smart, I went to school okay
I didn't finish but I went to elementary school
And I almost finished but now I'm smart and I'm gonna be in playboy
Oh my God, that's the greatest I'm gonna be in playboy
All the guys are gonna love me, I'm gonna be like Ana Nicole
And Pamela Anderson and Carmen Electra even but like I just might get married
I might find one of those rock star guys to marry me
It's gonna be so great, we're gonna have lots of babies
And I'm gonna get plastic surgery and fix up everything that's hanging
Oh my God, I'm gonna be so great, I'm gonna be a star

laugh-til-i-cry,2005,brooke-valentine,Hip-Hop,"Right from the start hell yeah
You were the one even without a kiss you were so much fun
Hurted me all the time but yet it felt so good
Knock me down but my love still stood
You didn't wanna hurt me but you still did
Couldn't see behind my back you split
Wrapped up in love I couldn't control it
Guess now I see just what it meant
I didn't know what real love was
All the hits you gave
Should had been hugs baby
I laughed till I cried
I seem so happy on the outside, baby
How was I to know it at that time
I was so busy laughing now I'm crying
And I can't deny some times were good
I wouldn't save myself if I could
Blind and naive I was a fool
And lucky me I ran into you
I ask you if you love me you say uh-uh
Wanna take me out you say uh-uh
Still had a way of getting to me
Hold me tight and I forget everything
Still to this day I think of you
You taught me how to see through the lies
And get to the truth
I laughed till I cried
I seem so happy on the outside
If I cry baby
I was so busy laughing now I'm crying
The laughter keeps going
And my hearts not showing it's lies
I wish I could show you how many times I cried
The laughter keeps going
And my hearts not showing it's lies
I wish I could show you how many times I cried
Yes, I laugh if I'm keep on crying
Keep on crying
I got to keep from dieing, baby
You love me, you lied to me
You're hurting me, you made me sad
I'm wishing love don't make me cry
It hurt so bad, it hurt so bad"

Back and forth, forth and back I keep pacing.
I stay the same while this world keeps changing.
I try to run but these walls got me caged in.
Is it real or just my imagination?
[Normal]
Back and forth, forth and back I keep pacing.
I stay the same while this world keeps changing.
I try to run but these walls got me caged in.
Is it real or just my imagination?
Sometimes I wonder if these walls know my deepest secrets,
from whom I love, to who I fall asleep with.
Can they see my sadness, my raging madness,
or that stack of porno magazines underneath my matress?
Can they hear my breathing, or my footsteps leaving?
Sneaking out my window ''cause I'm tired of my parents screaming.
Louder than Metallica playing with a symphony.
Louder than crowds in the eighties screaming for Tiffany.
I feel secluded, my thoughts feel polluted.
So I escape to music ''cause I think it's therapuetic, and,
this whole world can hate or love me, or think i'm ugly,
''cause unlike my friends these walls wont judge me.
These walls wont betray me, these walls are like my safety.
But sometimes I feel like these walls drive me crazy.
They enslave me or chase me by myself.
''cause if these walls see everything, why the fuck don't they help?
If these walls could talk they'd say,
that I was so damn lonely.
It feels like no one knows me.
These walls keep closing on me.
If these walls could talk they'd say,
that I was so damn lonely.
It feels like no one knows me.
These walls keep closing on me.
These walls are my leviathan, my cage, my lion's den.
I'm feeling trapped, strapped to this bed that I'm lying in.
I can't escape truth so I grab hold of my blanket,
counting the cracks on the ceiling for my own entertainment.
And this order, it feels like post mortem, shit,
I'd rather have my pumpkin smashed by Billy Corgan.
''cause these walls watch me fall asleep and wake up,
they've seen my first kiss, they've seen my parents break up.
They've seen how I like to make sure my door stays shut.
sometimes I like my privacy without it you'd see inside of me,
and fall to pieces like clothes with a bad seamstress.
These walls are my diary, my notepad, my Jesus.
A change of scenery is really all I need.
''cause these walls are closing in and it's hard for me to breathe.
It's hard for me to leave but not hard for me to fall.
I just don't wanna become another brick in the wall.
If these walls could talk they'd say,
that I was so damn lonely.
It feels like no one knows me
These walls keep closing on me.
If these walls could talk they'd say,
that I was so damn lonely.
It feels like no one knows me
These walls keep closing on me.

[Yas] alright -
[Bobby] See I would be there through thick and thin,
in sickness and in health, from beginning to end.
You gotta decide, me or him, Erica, tell me I'm curious.
[Yas] Bobby, I didn't mean to cut you off but are you really being serious?
You sound delirious, I can't believe I'm hearing this,
Erica's my girl, she always has been, period.
She hates you, what makes you think she would date you?
You got a new girl, like every week, at least I'm faithful.
[Bobby] Erica, take my advice, like how long have you known me?
I know Yas, he's the kind that'd leave you stranded and lonely.

all those pickup lines he uses, he read 'em in the last Maxim.
And ask him about how he likes to flirt with strangers.
He'd drop you in a second to watch the Indiana Pacers.

you'd have better luck hooking up with Stifler's Mom.
[Bobby] Listen, Erica's my soulmate, my fate, my world,

intro,2004,dead-celebrity-status,Hip-Hop,"I remember the stories they used to tell me,
about how beautiful and powerful she was.
She was a goddess amongst mortal men.
Every slight sound she made was a pure as an angel resting on her shoulder.
Every whisper she spoke, brought passion and clarity
to all those fortunate enough to hear her voice.
But that is no longer. Those are just stories from the past.
I see the way they treat her now, the way the disrespect and take advantage of her.
They used her for their own personal gain, success and pain.
They tricked her into thinking it was all done for love,
But really, it was done for money.
They say money is the root of all evil, but I know its people.
It's people who have carried out these treacherous crimes against her.
It is people who have tried to suck, and nearly drained the blood of her soul.
Her name is Music. She was once innocent, perfect.
But now I fear for the worst.
The day they drained her of all her blood, will be the day Music dies."
back-to-88,2004,dead-celebrity-status,Hip-Hop,"I could make a earth shake, I'm your worst mistake,
between skinny dipping and Camp Crystal Lake.
I feel like Rob Zombie, my thoughts are morbid,
like I slept in his house of a thousand corpses.
Put on a page, could shatter a giant's ribcage,
crush you and anyone that listen's to rage,
a vision of rage, it's like swimming with great whites.
slain mics, step up and feel the break tight.
I always like to show some decency,
but music always brings out the beast in me.
It's an animalistic misfit, so why risk it?
''cause this shit will leave a large imprint.
It's an instant classic, if not then it's close to it.
You disagree then you don't know music.
Most emcees that garble when it's time to write,
they got nothing to say, like a deaf man with writers block.
It's an animalistic so fuck what your friends think.
I work wonders with the pen's ink.
So what's a quote from your favourite artist?
If it aint Dead Celeb then it's probably garbage.
Long time coming, 15 years in the making,
it's finally come, but my lungs are acheing.
Watch how I make the beat bleed,
strangle the music 'till it can't breathe.
On it's whole, words are the life support.
Without me the song dies. Without me then it's lifeless.
Without me I'm just another fucking rapper with a crisis,
and a collection of songs about being rich.
Life's a big chain, it pushed you in the only which it ### thought containment.
We call it entertainment and you could love it or hate it.
You could turn it up, or turn it off, or just embrace it.
There's just too many stakes to regard it, all of them.
And they are starving and they feed off of music.
Walking zombies who choose to follow,
yeah some can spit, but most swallow.
I was always told that Rabbit seized the moment.
That's why I write with emotion.
Sing 'til i spit blood, sing for the hopeless,
sing 'til my lungs give out, and my throat closes.
That's just my ambition, to turn heads like a street magician.
David Blaine stopped paying attention.
It's the main attraction, the world premier.
Dead Celeb I thought I made it perfectly clear,
that i would not back down or stumble.
I just pace, back and forth, like a lion inside of a jungle.
This is my domain me and a mic go together,
like Robert Downey Junior and cocaine.
I'm just an addict, I got a bad habit,
of making the best emcees seem below average.
I'm just savage. I'm more than you bargain for.
That's why I hold the mic up into my arm and soar.
Lyrics are swarming I'm more than a hurricane,
and when I'm on it I'm more than a great white shark.
When I'm storming I'm ###.
And I don't like any of these rappers causing me boredom.
I kick a hole in the speaker once I'm done recording.
And my voice cuts sooner, cuts a chainsaw in Texas.
I got a face and it's fatal weapons.
Watch me rip the flesh from the beat
Skin it alive and hang a song from his feet.
''cause inside I'm dark and dingy,
like Donnie Darko was trapped within me.
I'm starving like the streets of Harlem.
and a quest that became with a ring like golem.
My precious, we need you, quick.
We need you like Dead Celebrity's Blood Music.
And I'm a scriptling direct from hell.
I'm hungry like when cannabis first battled Darnel.
I've come to rock down, you rock as my pumps.
I take this to new heights like suicide jumps.
You only live once, ### hunts.
And I get bloody, like it's the time of the month, bitch.
For those that can't spell, it's Y-A-S,
the most dangerous letters in the alphabet.
''cause facing me is like speaking English in Thailand,
there's really no point, like blindfolding a blind man.
DCS are the initials, for kids who got issues,
for kids who fight back like pitbulls.
You wanna battle? Check my win column.
I got two middle fingers with your name written on them. What?!"

And it's seems like my only friends are the TV, Maxim and FHM.
That's why I drink 'till I pass out think 'till I black out.
or watch Jay Leno 'till I crash out.
It's like this whole world's consumed on some Pink Floyd shit,
dark side of the moon, singing:
- We don't need no education. -
''cause my life's like poltregeist,
it sucks me in and I can't change the station.
- We don't need no thought control. -
And I try to really sleep as my life repeats,
like I'm trapped in a rerun of my own show.
So somebody turn off the lights. Turn these lights off.
So somebody show me you're there, and turn these lights on.
Do you mind if I flick this light switch?
''cause I don't want you to see me like this.
I'm not normal I'm a different creature.
You don't like me, I don't like me either.
I keep seeing things that I can't resist.
Got a girlfriend that barely knows I exist.
Or maybe it's the Lithium I'm on,
while I punch through crunch like Nirvana's song, saying:
- I feel stupid, and contagious. -
''cause everytime I shut my eyes, I see angels with dirty faces.
- Here we are now, entertain us. -
Now my life's got me seeing death,
like I'm back with the three witches of Macbeth.
So somebody turn off the lights. Turn these lights off.
So somebody show me you're there, and turn these lights on.
Where do you go when the lights go out?
Do you toss and turn and scream and shout?
I know.
- Why would you keep laughing?
I know.
Where do you hide when the sun goes down,
and darkness falls and no one's around?
I know.
- Why is love such a bad word?
Click click click in the night.
I know all bad things happen in threes.
And hearts skip beats like scratched cds.
When darkness falls, when strangers call,
like finding phone numbers, in bathroom stalls.
My back is against these walls of hatred.
I feel like I'm trapped between Freddy Vs Jason.
No escape from this blue lagoon.
That's why I shout like I'm Ozzy, and I bark at the moon.
So somebody turn off the lights.
- Somebody turn these lights off.
So somebody show me you're there and turn these lights on.
- So somebody show me you're there.
So somebody turn off the lights.
- Somebody turn these lights off.
So somebody show me you're there and turn these lights on.
- So somebody show me you're there.
Click click click in the night."

Been a muslim my whole life and I ain't never met no terrorist.
Why would I watch tv? All they do is try to embarrass us.
Nine eleven was disasterous. Fuck those devil advocates.
My religion is peace love and happiness.
This shock cannot be televised for free.
''cause bright lights and dead bodies make for great TV.
The world is panicking, Mr Bush is mad again.
Watching them bombs drop, makes me sick to my abdomen.
What doesn't kill you can only make you strong.
Then I feel like I'm carrying the weight of the world with one arm.
When bombs are being dropped from planes, media affects our brains,

In this day and age it's rage and life destruction.
Lyposuction and breast implants, like a Hollywood star
with her lips and chest enhanced.
It's just plastic surgery for the less advanced.
White lies, great for religion, sex, and churches.
Politicians sniffing white lies behind closed curtains.
Overpaid athletes stick steroids in ass cheeks.
Million dollar salaries depend on players that cheat.
The young and homeless live amongst the trash heeps.
last week's news is forgotten, dead stiff and rotten,
like the corpse of Andy Hoffman.
They say peace sells, but who's buying? I say sex sells.
In these days and times, the public loves it,
they can't get enough of it, anything else says rubbish.
Mp3s and burnt cds, lead us to believe that music is now free.
The industry's in a panic, major labels running frantic.
World's best mechanic couldn't fix it.
Empty seats means kids can't afford a ticket, and it's a problem.

This blood music, lick your thumbs and skim through it.
I'd bleed a thousand times if I had to.
Scratch and claw my way to the top.
It's like every verse is worth a penny for my thought,
and I haven't been paid yet, guess i'll just stay in bed.
Baby-step my way through this bullshit business.
I'll kick and scream until this world listens.
That's why I write till my hand hurts.
Make music for the love of it, but always put my fans first.
Spill my guts, every time I write shit,
so you can lick my two nuts if you don't like.
Some people hate it, some anticipate it.
Some think it's so-so, others think it's over-rated.
But Dead Celeb is something I hold sacred.
Waiting for the day I can say I finally made it.

''cause it's raised me, it's changed me, it's made me.

And if it comes sooner than expected,

When you just gotta let it out, it's blood music.
When you wanna show the world what you're about, it's blood music.
That's why i use it for therapuetic reasons.
Is it me talking or is the music bleeding?
It helps put me to sleep when I need it to.
You might not believe in it, but it believes in you.
When you can feel it in your gut, it's blood music.
You feel like you've finally had enough, it's blood music.
When you would rather die than give up, it's blood music.
When you do it, and do it for the love, it's blood music.
Music is my blood, lyrics are my skeleton.
My music is a drug ''cause i feed the beat heroine.

The quicker they come, the quicker they crawl.
Dead Celeb's coming back with this brand new track.
Here's another taste from our swinging battle axe.
You wanna be a star, here's a gimmick and a style,
To mimmick and free clothes to help design your image.
I feel like the only way I'll see fame and wealth,
Is to kill myself the same week my record hits the shelf.
All you really need is a record label budget,
Then watch the machine force feed it to the public.
Hate it or love it, watch it or unplug it.
Careers disappear quicker than next week's club hit.
You're just a puppet on a string I'm your master.
You're not cut out to sing, you might as well be an actor.
Or write a chapter how sex sells music,
Nobody likes your songs, they watch your videos muted.
Mixed and diluted, polluted trashed will crash.
This prostitute music selling songs with ass,
I gasp for breath, Dead Celeb pass the test.
Music for a living? I can't ask for less.

What would you do for that big contract?
Change your face like Michael, be on American Idol?
Act homicidal and eat your own intestines.
I thought we were musicians not Fear Factor contestants.
Overnight stars want credit? Forget it.
Yeah, you went platinum, but who bought your record?
Extra philosophy, behind a music prodigy.
The next best thing since The Motley Crue Biography.
It's like Gods become a shark in deep water.
You swim up to the mainstream, then you bite the author.
You could be a star, too, if you're near edges.
Fuck the opinions of these haters and critics.
They can be so cynic, quick to call you a gimmick.
You can't tarnish my image, you can't write it, I live it.

I got the world in my hands, you could have it too.
I got two middle fingers and they're pointed at you!

I'm the messiah, I'm anti-celebrity,
I'm anti-war like John Lennon in the 70's.
Dead Celeb's the movement, your the student,
It's time to change the world kids!
Here's the blue-print.
Something smells like teen spirit,
Like the ghost of Kurt Cobain wrote these lyrics,
And forced America to listen,
With a million angry misfits screamin', ""Fuck the system!""
I'm the pain in Axel Rose's diary,
That's why an appetite for destruction lives inside of me.
I'm not - your - typical lyricist,
Acting gangsta and sellin' out appearences.
They need to take a musicology class,
So thank God the prince has finally come back,
To save from the whack water at El Creek's sideshow,
I'm the anti-American teen idol!
(Chorus x 2)
Like the hands of Michael Jackson's plastic surgeon,
Changin' music into a different person.
I took it's face and changed it, replaced it,
Surgically, verbally, gave it a face lift.
Now it's some new shit we callin' Blood Music
For Dead Celeb fans who can relate to it.
(And now!)
So let the games begin, you either turn with the world or you watch it spin.
If your dreams were stolen by a liar,
Then steal it back like your name is Winona Ryder.
Don't be afraid, be stronger, divide and conquer,
Come out swingin' like Ozzfest concerts.
Times up, I'm callin' you to rise up,
No more walking blind with your eyes shut.
Find a message hidden in these chapters
Like Black Sabbath records played backwards!
(Chorus x2)

I'll fight for this like it's a violent game,
I'm in between Grand Theft Auto and Max Payne. I'm the magic in the hands of David Blain,
Spit so much that I'll leave this microphone stained.
Along came a spider, spinnin' webs of hatred.
Welcome to the wonderful world of entertainment,
Where stars are born and celebrities tell lies,
The revolution will now be televized!

Move! I got two middle fingers and they're pointed at you.
Move! I got two middle fingers and they're pointed at you.
Move! I got two middle fingers and they're pointed at you.
Move! I got two middle fingers and they're pointed at,
Fuck you!"

red handed, caught cheating, my hearts beating. Do I deserve this?
I used to love her, but now I wanna watch her suffer.
It makes me sick to my stomach thinking she sleeps with others.
I wanna break her pictures. I wanna burn her pictures.
Everything we had was wrong and now I'm glad it's gone with her.
She was a liar, denying that things were alright.
but meanwhile, she was up fucking him all night.
And all the things that you said, are now stuck in my head.
I'm such an idiot, to let you crawl back in my bed.
Those phone numbers in your back pocket weren't mine,
so fuck you both don't act like it's the first time.

While you were sleeping, I was out creeping.
Said I went out with friends, but i was cheating.
When you were at home, I was at his home.
Slept in his bed, you slept alone.
We used to be together, thought it would be forever.
Until she turned around and ripped my heart right through my sweater.
How come you're so ungrateful. How come this feels so painful.
You're not so perfect, was it worth it to be so unfaithful
How could i be so naive? Sometimes I'm too trusting.
She sleeps with me and then she sleeps with him that's so disgusting.
Touching other people's property, obviously you're down with O.P.P.
That makes your nature naughty.
Everything she ever told me was a fucking lie.
Everything she ever did was with some other guy.
We should have never hooked up, thought you were one of a kind.
You wanna act like a slut? Then do it on your own time.

Oh my God I never knew love was so fatal.
She makes Paris Hilton look like a fucking angel
That backstabbing bitch, what happened made me sick.
It's the same story, different author, man, the same old shit.
I want a perfect girl, it's not a perfect world,
cause she's a superstar gold-digging type of girl.
my dear, my dear, my dear, you do not know me but I know you very well.
And let me tell you that you make my life a, living hell.
I'm living well without you, I doubt you, will ever really see
the amount of trash you amount to.
She's a partial lover, undercover, no class.
So take them three minutes and shove them up your stupid ass.
I hope you're smart enough to learn from your dumb mistakes.
cause if not, you'll learn the hard way when the condom breaks.

On the inside she's dying, lying to herself, thinking:
- 5 more pounds won't jeopardize my health.
One day she might just collapse, she can't avoid it.
Too many sleepless nights spent bent over a toilet.
Spewing vomit, like she was an alcoholic.
Praying to a God she never believed in to stop it.

''cause she traded in the morning workouts for morning sickness.
Feeling nauseous, sleeps on a mat because she's cautious.
Give life or take life, that's her only options.
Only if she had a magic wand, she'd go back to that night
and put her clothes back on.
But she can't change time, or what's growing inside.
How could she love something that's barely alive?
Her body's acheing, shaking, from sweaty palms, and cold sweat.
Mentally exhausting like phone sex.
No regrets, life or death, it's high stakes.

Ask any politican and they'll tell you its true,
Its a fact music makes you violent,
Like Michael Jackson telling little Timmy to be silent,
You don't believe me? here's my hype,
Offer me the record and i'll show you the type,
Of criminal this rap shit is breedin,
Its a fact that MC Hammer left me bleedin,
Vanilla Ice made my mother say 'Fuck',
If I stuck with UB40 then I woulda been in luck,
But I didn't I got it wrong,
Cypress fucking hill to me to make a fucking bong,
So I started, I bought another tape,
That bad boy vibe made my cock and balls ache,
So remember kids from the head double tap,
Guns don't kill people its just rap!
[Chorus]
Guns don't kill people rappers do
So of the police
Woo woo woo
Guns don't kill people rappers do,
I seen it in a documentary on BBC2,
Shot to death outside Hyper Value,
Guns blazin like Michael Cain in Zulu,
Guns with sadistic are sometimes misleading,
The type of criminal that rap is breedin,
Shot in the chest? No wonder you stopped breathin,
2 for the base over, are you receivin?
Remember rap tracks in '87
Scott the Rock's up ni Hip-Hop heaven,
Biggie and Tupac R.I.P,
Even Jam Master Jays in the cemetary.
[chorus]
Guns don't kill people rappers do,
I'm a fucking rapper and I might kill you,
As a rapper I'm teachin you a lesson,
AK47 to Smith-and-Weston
Just say no, just like Zappo
Bullet proof vest, to guns and ammo,
Hip-hop gangster trippin,
Even Eminems into pistol whippin,
Its like cluedo murder one,
P-Diddy, J'lo in a nightclub with a gun,
Heard snoop dog now wants to bust a cap,
Guns don't kill people its just rap
One, Two yo face my shoe,
My name is Mike Balls and I'm comin through,
Gun crimes, stabbin, and burglarisation,
Its on a rise all across the nation,
The safety's off and the pistol is aimed,
Yardies and the Mafia always get blamed,
Politicians are shamed, and they haven't got a clue,
Rap is more deadly than fucking Kung-Fu
[Chorus]
Guns don't kill people rappers do,
From Bristol Zoo to B&Q;,
I want to rap, I want to rhyme
Heard it in a song now I'm into gun crime,
Its a sign of the times like Prince changin his name,
Gotta have a shooter to be in the rap game,

Guns don't kill people its just rap!

I needs some hype I think I'll ram raid happy shopper
Haven't got a car so I use a space hopper
Bouncing to the window, cut my head, show stopper
I want a hundred fans, 200 teeny boppers
I want police protection from 87 coppers
I wanna go gold even better platinum
If you wanna be a star you gotta kill yourself, man
It's the truth step back, take a look around
Elvis is dead for being fat, 500 pound
Kurt Cobain's rich as fuck he's buried in the ground
Jimi Hendrix and his amp still ain't makin' no sound
Michael hutchence, he's one of 'em too
Made a hundred million quid dying tossing on the loo
S U I C I D E
It might be messy but it's money for free
Suicide is painless or so it has been said
I could've killed myself but I'd be better off dead
So I took a deep breath, put a gun against my head
Pulled the trigger, click, should've been eating lead
But I wasn't, I was naked in john frost square
Mothers with pushchairs stopped and stared
For this situation I was quite unprepared
Tried suicide to be famous but nobody cared
Committing suicide to enhance my career
It worked for mickey and Tupac Shakir
Jesus was nailed up to some wood
2000 years later and book sales are still good
I heard in a song suicide is painless
And it's 80% sure to make you famous
W4nking with a bag on yer head tied to a door
That bloke from I-N-X-S he knew the score
S U I C I D E, it might be messy but it's money for free
S U I C I D E, it might be messy but it's money for free
I gotta kill myself, I gotta do's it quick
John entwistle sly, he was snorting arsenic
I keep taking all this coke to make me die
Doin' more drugs than they make in fuckin' I-C-I
It's the best way to go, don't think me dull
I'm not gonna fall off the roof like the flid rod hull
We want people to sing all our songs
And the nuns at saint Joseph's rappin' on smokin' bongs
We wanna be remembered when we're six feet under
For hip-hoppin' not robins fuckin' beatings or plunder
At the moment I'm not dead like David kampasey
Double platinum means you gotta be pushin' up daisies
Dad's army's all dead, every last one
But the cents are still going on BBC1
Yeah that's right I smoke draw from wales
Suicide's a good idea to improve vinyl sales
It's useless, it's crap, I'll never be in the sun
How can I be a pop star when I can't buy a gun?
Jimmy Morrison overdosed in the bath
I know, I'll hang myself with my scarf
Tied to the stairs, dangling by my neck
The cord length I forgot to check
Stuck it for a week, unable to shriek
The landlord found me and he called me a freak
He cut me down and started to laugh
'if you're dead next week gimme your autograph'
You know I thanked him, returned to my room
The new plan is to go out with a boom
To the station, with a petrol can
Five pound please, I say to the man
All set up and ready to burn
The wheel on my lighter just won't turn
Suicide is a suicyclebbbl
Suicide is a suicyclebbbl
Suicide is a suicyclebbbl, I wanna be famous after I die
Proven fact, man, if you're dead you sell more
That drummer from def leopard, his arm has made 30 times more than he has
You know our elvis? well, he's dead famous now and he's dead and he's fa
He's more famous now like
He's dead like you know, that's what it's all about like
It's fuckin' simple economics
They reckon bob marley's dead but he's not, man,
Cause he was on the TV last night, man
Just don't lie to me, man
I thought I was havin' a go at an overdose,
But I I I don't think you can overdose on beechams flu plus
I think one of the blokes off of dads army is still alive,
I think he's bumming martin in eastenders innit?
I'll get the ropes, and we'll tie them to the walls,
And we all jump off at the same time and break our necks
And we'll make at least 13 quid and you
Knows we'll be famous like fuckin' Gandhi
Or like the bloke off that sex film we seen"
you-knows-i-loves-you,2004,goldie-lookin-chain,Hip-Hop,"I'm gonna make you sweat
The way a pig sweats on a hot day
'cause I'm feelin' real sexy, baby, real sexy, ooh yeah
That's right, I'm gonna put me a sexy video on
I'm gonna massage some oil into my body, baby
'cause I'm gonna get tight with you, yeah
I wanna take you to McDonald's with a candle
Girl, it's my love you can't handle
I see you walkin' on the way home from work
Your Tesco tunic really drives me berserk
I'm for real, it ain't no quirk
My love is lurkin' the way a rapist would lurk
In a bush, or a car park in town
I bought you this necklace, it cost me 12 pounds
From Argos, Elizabeth Duke
Maybe you're the skywalker to my Luke
The Darth to the vader, flip over the crossfader
I'll serenade you with a bag of space raiders
Or Walkers or Smiths or maybe even Quavers
'cause my love for you is like drugs for ravers
With glow sticks and funny hats on
I loves you more than I loves my bong
Fantasy
You and me baby
You and me baby
Oh, you fuckin' knows I love you right
But the thing is it's like this
You see, I can feel it inside
I can't explain how it feels
My sexual love is for real
Girl, you knows it's true, like Milli Vanilli
I'll buy you ten fags on a day trip to Caerphilly
I'm after your heart, oh, don't you see?
And your three kids doesn't bother me
You know
I'll give you a rose, pull out your chair when we eat
Fuck I can't, in McDonald's it's a bolted seat
Don't matter 'cause I'm here with you
With a medium value meal and a chocolate sundae too
Later on I'll come and help you sign on
I'll stare into your eyes, the housin' benefits gone wrong
Don't worry, baby it won't take too long
I'm just sittin', I'm just waitin', I'm just writin' this song
You know that, time passes and I'm lovin' every second
Buyin' chips for you is as lovely as I reckoned
You're Victoria Spice, I'm David Beckham
If you were Dellboy, I'd be the streets of Peckham
Why don't you come to me? Why can't you see?
My love for you is like Matt Bolan to a tree
Dance with me
You and me, baby
You and me, baby
Tonight
I'll take you for a ride, we won't go far
You've been runnin' through my mind like a shinin' star
We've got plenty of time to make sweet love
""'cause tonight's the night we take off the glove
You know what I mean, you're takin' the pill
Don't worry, I'll sort out the bill
Supported by the D-H-S-S
With family allowance, we'll sort out the mess
What's it gonna take to get your attention?
A tracksuit and gold chain and semi erection
Say no more, I can feel the tear
You can smokes my fags and drinks my beer
I'll never want another like I want you
To prove my love, I gotta tattoo, on my bollocks
I was gonna have your name but I only got initials
'cause I couldn't stand the pain
My physical love
You and me baby
You and me baby
Tonight
The emotional reality
You're the nicest lookin' woman outside of my sexmags
Especially with your makeup, when your wearin' your Gladrags
I gotta tell you, I gotta let you know
I wanna buy you trips down the Mecca, Bingo
We'll sit together, get four in a row
And win a China dog and with it too a family show
This is romance, how it should be done
When it's you and me together, it can only spell fun
We'll walk together, buy some meat in the market
I'll piss on the car, you'll smile and park it
I've got to tell you about somethin' I think
Without you and my chain I'm the weakest link
So get down, baby, and feel my love
I'll get you drunk in Weatherspoons, into a bush I shove
I'll have a grope and get the last bus
A romantic date, just the two of us
Yeah, one time
You and me baby
You and me baby
Tonight
Electrical Love
You and me baby
You and me baby
Tonight
I'm feeling kind of, kind of sexy, baby

the-maggot,2004,goldie-lookin-chain,Hip-Hop,"Space man blow up
Oh, maggot, he's a modern day fagan
Turfin' out your pockets like a Christian burns a pagan
Drippin' with charm, style and panache
He'll leave you sore like a venereal rash
They tried to catch him, he says, time to dash
He always leaves a party with a wallet full of cash
He's a bastard but he's always lookin' flash
With his shoes like Dick Turpin across his waist he wears a sash
Sportin' top hat with a pocket watch too
With the tallest member of the Goldie lookin' crew
Watch out, if he's there when you're pissed
He learnt his science from the man, Oliver Twist
Of his crimes, we tried to compile a list
Sellin' sexy DVD's of a Willy being kissed
Stealin' pensions on the old and infirm
Made a fortune sellin' doctors fake sperm
Like Charles Dickens there's a lesson to be learned
Beware, the maggot 'cause the worm has turned
All of the youth shall witness the day that Babylon shall fall
Just like Jack, the Ripper he'll do you up a kipper
He's like a highway man holdin' up a Newport nipper
He's smarter than Sherlock Holmes or I TV's Taggart
I'm dapper refined and they call me the maggot
Turn your back and your pocket he will pick
His eyes and talons are fukin' deadly equipped
Like a chameleon, I'm the master thief
Usin' a disguise dressed like Penelope Keith
You gotta smoke a reefer or two
You gotta smoke a reefer or two
You gotta smoke a reefer or two
You gotta smoke a reefer or two
I steal money and hide it in my rectal hole
To takin' belongings in my ultimate goal
I'll take your China and your silver and your soul
By darkness and night I shimmy up the drain-pipe
The maggot, the maggot, that's who I am
Don't ever trust me, always doin' a scam
I punched a woman and stole the baby and a pram
I even sliced my penis up and sold it as ham
Gold chains and watches, maggot's got plenty
He pinched them from ladies and upset the gentry
Like Sherlock Holmes bummin' Watson, it's elementary
He's the modern day menace of the nineteenth century
A gentleman thief, a scholar and a rogue
Doing the locomotion like Kylie Minogue
He's got the strength of ten like a maniac
And I'm also identified as Spring-heeled Jack
Here he comes, watch out, son, he'll rip you off
Here he comes, he's a money grabbin' bastard from Newport
I'm maggot with the GLC big shout to all the Valleys
Free Dick Turpin and the ring stinger
Big up to Dipper Nan Merthyr Connection
Postman Port big shout out to Postman Port
And Mark, runnin' the bar, always sorts it big up Hafodrynys hotel
Big up to Pontllanfraith crew also the west end crew Abercarn
Did a wheelie on a Penny Farthing, big wheel up, big wheel up
All the bus routes, X-15, 53, big respect
Red and white [?] at cross keys
And their rivals Glynn Williams
Respect to you all say, all those that know fake Elvis

Flip the cash and take my cut
It's really powerful, it's so strong
But I'm selling it fast and it's nearly all gone
I'll sell you the 9-bar or just the ounce
I'll sell you little bits or large amounts
Adam Hussain, remember me?
Selling draw from my Capri
Want some draw? With me you'll score
Cos I grows this shit out o' my nan's back door
Bongs big as, blow buckets,
I sell like ounces to schoolkids but I don't care, fuck it
Get it on tick, but make it quick
I just got a load of wicked Thai stick
Party's going down, I'll bring the brown
Tonight it's going off in Newport town
[Chorus]
I got 21 ounces of blow
I got 21 ounces of blow
So if you want some let me know, cos I really gotta go
I got 21 ounces of blow, blow, blow
People watch me like Match of the Day
I've got a stack of weed like a bale of Hay
I drive my Capri like Colin Macrae
And I gotta drop some weed off in Alway
I've got really good scales and my deals and my deals are proper
The prices is wicked too just like Happy Shopper
I sells the best skunk you tell by the smell
I'll also sell you fags and Rizlas as well
Oi, clart! Don't fuckin' start
Or I'll whip you with my chain and it'll fuckin' smart
Weed's green, like a frog
My frown will make you shake like a shitting dog

Cos the boot's rammed with Mary Jane
That's right, it's Benny Blanco
Selling the speed and the blow
Out of my car, cos that's how it's done
Pigs bust me twice and it got me on the run
Adam Hussain, I'm fuckin' GLC,
Cos if you wanted THC come see me
There's a new dance going on,
In Newport, it's called the funky bong
You wiggle your hips and start to show off
Breathe in and out and then you cough
You can only do it when you're smoking a cone
You can do it with your mates or all alone
Right to the left, left to the right
GLC and the funky bong, alright?
[Chorus]
I got 21 ounces of blow
I got 21 ounces of blow
So if you want some let me know, cos I really gotta go
I got 21 ounces of blow, blow, blow
Raw speed, whatever you need
Cos I've always got a big bag of weed
My shit ain't bunk, I sell skunk
Out of my low-ride Capri's trunk
Wanna gurn? You better learn
Your missus'll get free pills burping my worm
She's on all fours, wouldn't touch her with yours
Cos she looks like the wookie outta fuckin' Star Wars

half-man-half-machine,2004,goldie-lookin-chain,Hip-Hop,"Benatone Spectrum, Pacman, Commodore
ZX-81, Donkey Kong, fucking high score
Push it to the limit, couldn't push it any more
Wanna be a fucking robot after smoking loads of draw
Bought a speak and spell, stuck it to my chest
And wrap some fucking tinfoil to my head and to my vest
Walking down the street, my next door neighbors not impressed
I'm a robot and buying ten fags is my quest
Eggsie's gone too far, he thinks he's Robocop
He's covered in tinfoil and he's got matching metal socks
We tried to sedate him but he fucking escaped
The man robot myth starts to escalate
He tries to sell himself standing in Curry's
But if the police turn up, he runs in a fucking hurry
He tries to plug himself in the mains with his nob
And when he's fully recharged he goes out on the rob
Half man, half machine
What does it mean?
What does it mean?
Half man, half machine
What does it mean?
What does it mean?
Being a robot in my digital domain
Enter my world, feel my pain
I'm not like other people you might see or you might know
I made love to a BBC micro
Touching on the disk drive, the monitor got hot
I knew from then, I was a motherfucking robot
Bill Gates from Microsoft, Stephen Hawking's voice
And fucking Lara Croft
I built a lab, secret in my loft
And built a special costume that would help me to jack off
I sat there in front of the screen
For many years, this had been my wet dream
Now I've reached it, I'm finally there
Like Terminator being filmed in Aberdare
So alone, when people stop and stare
Like C3PO but with pubes and hair
Robot Love
Robot
Robotic break dancing
Robot
The doctors found a nut
They said he was an head case
'Cos he sticks silver and cans on his face
Sucking off antennas and trying to fuck the fridge
And burnt his pubic wig, with the high voltage
I am a robot
My prime directive is to's go to's the shops
And buy's ten fags
Do's you's compute?
He wants to buy ten fags, his destination is the shops
A tinfoil suit and a hat like Robocop
If your ask him then he'll do a body pop
Like Terminator, yeah he just won't stop
Put electrical cable down through the eye of his cock
Plugged it in the wall and gave himself a big shock
The reason that he did it wasn't to give himself pain
Watching Terminator over again and again
Fuck man, get him, fucking restrain him man
Get him fucking, fucking get him down man
Inject him man, get him down
He's fucking nuts man and he's losing it
Help me man, just get him fucking

soap-bar,2004,goldie-lookin-chain,Hip-Hop,"Burned a new hole in my tracksuit today,
Smoking Soap Bar without an ashtray,
Red-hot nylon dripping on my skin,
I ripped the fucker off, and threw it in the bin,
Soap Bar?s cheap, and so?s my clothes,
they've got to be cause of all the fucking holes,
It tastes like shit and it makes you cough,
And it?s the fucking rubber in it that gets you off.
Yeah, I smoke Soap Bar with lots of bits of plastic,
I leaves mine in it cause it tastes fantastic,
Skunk costs too much, I can't see the appeal,
Of smoking Port Rocky, Soap Bar or Gold Seal,
Smoke Rocky in a bong, bucket or hot-knives,
Bake it in a cake for your Mam as a surprise,
I smokes Green, and it?s gone in an instant,
But Soap Bar lasts, cause it?s fucking consistent.
Smoking on up, Soap Bar in the sky,
I?ll smoke Soap Bar ?till I fucking die,
Before I die and they lay me to rest,
I will always smoke Soap Bar, that's the best.
Last night I went out driving in my car,
I sparked up a fat spliff of fucking Soap Bar,
A Blim-burn burned right down to my dick,
And while I was distracted, I fucking crashed into a
Brick wall, the car was fucking battered,
The bonnet flipped up and the windscreen shattered,
you're better off smoking The Green instead,
Cause it don't Blim-Burn and it?s better for your head.
Soap Bar! Sitting in a deep sweat,
Thinking! I've got to get some Rocky for the,
Weekend! The sight of Draw excites me,
Stick it in a bong, light it up and chug a fucking,
Whitey! Burning holes in my tracky,
This shit always happens when I'm smoking fucking Rocky,
you've heard it on the news; you've seen it on the telly,
Add up for moving Soap Bar down fucking Liz Werry
?I do it like a little cause light the fucking thing as always?
I used to smoke Skunky but it was far too smelly, man!
Smoking on up, Soap Bar in the sky,
I?ll smoke Soap Bar ?till I fucking die,
Before I die and they lay me to rest,
I will always smoke Soap Bar, that's the best.
Most Soap Bar comes from fucking Holland,
They make it out of oil, and tires and pollen,
Diesel, Miramar, Flat-Press too;
These are types of Soap Bar available to you,
These little bits of plastic you find inside;
You can use those as a quality guide,
Of the standard of Soap Bar that you are smoking,
The more bits of plastic means the better the toking.
Eat a Hash-cake but wait a while,
it'll take about an hour ain't Draw versatile,
You can burn it, eat it, or smoke it in a spliff,
Space shakes, Draw gateau?s, you knows it Delia Smith,
Lying in your bed dropping blimps on your pubes,
Selling Draw to your mates but it?s really Oxo cubes,
When you're cooking up draw, be quick don't lick it,
Cause it?s really fucking hot and it'll burn your fingers.
This bloke said to me; ?You haven't got a clue,
About the damage that Soap Bar can do to you?,
I tried to see things from his point of view,
But I couldn't fit my head up his asshole too,
The bloke was wrong, I knows my stuff,
I knows if I smoke it, I'm gonna feel rough,
My lungs are fucked and my throat is raw,
Cause the thing about Soap Bar; it?s fucking hardcore.
Smoking on up, Soap Bar in the sky,
I?ll smoke Soap Bar ?till I fucking die,
Before I die and they lay me to rest,
I will always smoke Soap Bar, that's the best.
Well anyway I think it?s better myself to lean forwards,
When smoking Soap Bar, because you are less likely to Blim-Burn,
You know what I mean?
Innit, check it out man! I got some quality fucking Gold-Seal for you, innit?
Shape up all those little bits of plastic what you find inside, right,
And then fucking stick them in a teapot,
Makes a lovely cup of tea, that does.
What I do, stick a fag in the microwave, right,
You toke it up, you sticks the Draw on top,
And you rams it in a bong and you rams the bong in your fucking head.
Yeah that's like my fucking lungs feel like,
they're fucking collapsing sometimes from the Soap Bar like,
You know?"
roller-disco,2004,goldie-lookin-chain,Hip-Hop,"Hey, the first time that I met my mate
Was in the roller rink where I went to skate
It was early in the decade around '83
Back then Maskell's was the place to be
Pay two quid for your entry fee
I glide into the arena, ecstasy
When you were seven you didn't realize
Most of the adults were stoned out of their eyes
Some jacked up on the seats around the edge
Others were so fucked that they turned into veg
I didn't care 'cause I made my pledge
Rollskating at Maskell's got respect
I used to listen to Public Enemy
Erik be and Rakim and BVSMP
But before that in 1983
I'd go break dancing after my tea
Down the Youth Club, eating the fruit pastels
Saturday morning I'd go down to Maskell's
It was my favorite place to go
Dancing all day at the Roller Disco
N-n-nineteen eighty three
When Maskells is over it's out on your bike
Doing bunny hops and wheelies if you like
Nicking from the shop and comparing your Nike
Dropping bricks onto trains was a delight
Then I'd find a weak kid and have a fight
Use your pocket money to buy a head band for the night
From Fussels, Newport's health-sports store
This is the stuff I used to do before
Draw Paul Hardcastle, n-n-nineteen
Was always played on the roller disco scene
I would listen to the music 'til I went deaf
Skating around backwards to Axel F
Even back then I was still wearing gold
They had an ice rink upstairs so I was told
It was ecstasy going round a pillar
Doing a special dance to Michael Jackson's 'Thriller'
why-why-you fukin' knows it
N-n-nineteen eighty three
How was the year son?
N-n-nineteen eighty three
Oh, eating cola cubes and watching Grange Hill
Riding my chopper to the Chip shop in Pill
I didn't know words like Cunny or Vag
Getting my two hundred meters swimming badge
Back then you were seven, I was eight
I only just started to masturbate
When I was in school the days went slow
'cause I was dreaming of a fuckin' roller disco
F-f-fucking alright
S-s-say first fuck
I didn't smoke, I didn't drink booze
I collected 'Star Wars' stickers and bubble gum tattoos
Stuck 'em on my face 'cause it made me feel hard
Then popped into the shop to buy some football cards
Finished the album, Panini '83
Get back home in time for the A-Team and tea
Then watch Bullseye and Saint and Greavsie
Go to bed, 'til tomorrow, see?
I watch the A-Team and Airwolf too
Before I found drugs and started sniffing glue
Riding round the lane on my Grifter or my Chopper
Even back then I was a hip hopper
N-n-nineteen eighty three
N-n-nineteen eighty three
Why-why-you knows it
F-f-fresh bra
F-f-fresh bra
why-why-you knows it
F-f-fresh bra

manifesto,2004,goldie-lookin-chain,Hip-Hop,"Hey, lick the tip, why dont'cha
In 1983, a team of crack draw enthusiasts created a master plan.
A design for a way of livin' so revolutionary, so groundbreaking,
That its very concept posed a threat to the fabric of society.
A threat even greater than that of having a stiffy whilst standing
In the middle of a Glyn Williams' coach full of nuns.
The implications of this radical movements' political manifesto
Posed a threat to the UK authorities who in turn drove its founder
Members under ground."

Guns don't kill people rappers do,
Ask any politican and they'll tell you its true,
Its a fact music makes you violent,
Like Michael Jackson telling little Timmy to be silent,
You don't believe me? here's my hype,
Offer me the record and i'll show you the type,
Of criminal this rap shit is breedin,
Its a fact that MC Hammer left me bleedin,
Vanilla Ice made my mother say 'Fuck',
If I stuck with UB40 then I woulda been in luck,
But I didn't I got it wrong,
Cypress fucking hill to me to make a fucking bong,
So I started, I bought another tape,
That bad boy vibe made my cock and balls ache,
So remember kids from the head double tap,
Guns don't kill people its just rap!
[Chorus]
Guns don't kill people rappers do
So of the police
Woo woo woo
Guns don't kill people rappers do,
I seen it in a documentary on BBC2,
Shot to death outside Hyper Value,
Guns blazin like Michael Cain in Zulu,
Guns with sadistic are sometimes misleading,
The type of criminal that rap is breedin,
Shot in the chest? No wonder you stopped breathin,
2 for the base over, are you receivin?
Remember rap tracks in '87
Scott the Rock's up ni Hip-Hop heaven,
Biggie and Tupac R.I.P,
Even Jam Master Jays in the cemetary.
[chorus]
Guns don't kill people rappers do,
I'm a fucking rapper and I might kill you,
As a rapper I'm teachin you a lesson,
AK47 to Smith-and-Weston
Just say no, just like Zappo
Bullet proof vest, to guns and ammo,
Hip-hop gangster trippin,
Even Eminems into pistol whippin,
Its like cluedo murder one,
P-Diddy, J'lo in a nightclub with a gun,
Heard snoop dog now wants to bust a cap,
Guns don't kill people its just rap
One, Two yo face my shoe,
My name is Mike Balls and I'm comin through,
Gun crimes, stabbin, and burglarisation,
Its on a rise all across the nation,
The safety's off and the pistol is aimed,
Yardies and the Mafia always get blamed,
Politicians are shamed, and they haven't got a clue,
Rap is more deadly than fucking Kung-Fu
[Chorus]
Guns don't kill people rappers do,
From Bristol Zoo to B&Q;,
I want to rap, I want to rhyme
Heard it in a song now I'm into gun crime,
Its a sign of the times like Prince changin his name,
Gotta have a shooter to be in the rap game,
Like Michael Ryan about to snap,
Guns don't kill people its just rap!

your-mothers-got-a-penis,2004,goldie-lookin-chain,Hip-Hop,"That's right, you knows what I'm saying
Your mother's offered me the goods, I'm not paying.
It started as a laugh, as a bit of a joke
Something funny to say when I was having a smoke.
I first heard off this bloke, this fucking rumour going round
Your mother's reputation it's not sound
She's saving up the pennies hoping they'd turn into pounds
To have an operation to swap her gender around.
It's a shock to me and it's a shock to you
Your mother's got a beard, sandals and a penis too
It don't look right see, when she's walking down the street
To see her ball bag jiggin' to the beat of her feet
I said
Your mother's got a penis
Your mother's got a penis
Your mother's got a penis
That's right
Your mother's got a penis
In internet rooms and computer mainframes
There's loads of females but your mother's blue veins.
Not the ones in her legs or the backs of her arms
But the ones in her member head and in her garms.
She walks around proud, with a short dress on
Which sometimes exposes the tip of her dong.
Often it's dripping, sometimes it's dry
No matter when I see her there's a tear in my eye.
I thought I had to tell you, had to put it in a letter
But I thought fuck that I'd write a song in much better.
The only way to do it, to really let you know
I could prove it because I gave it a blow.
It was purely accidentally because she got me really drunk
And she made me kiss her elephant trunk.
You know why? That's right
Your mother got a penis.
Your mother's got a penis (Your mother's got a penis)
Your mother's got a penis (Your mother's got a penis)
Your mother's got a penis (Your mother's got a penis, see'mon)
That's right
Your mother's got a penis (Your mother's got a penis)
Your mother's got a penis (Your mother's got a penis)
Your mother's got a penis (Your mother's got a penis)
Your mother's got a penis (Let's Rock !)
That's right
Your mother's got a penis
When she walks down the street, then she walks like John Wayne
I just seen her pissing standing up again.
Don't make no sense when you see her here and there
She got a cock and balls and real pubic hair.
And a single eye that sometimes weeps
If she lying on the bed then she rubs it on the sheets
Or up against the door or the back of your neck
If your mother's around then you make a double check.
I hate to tell you with all due respect
Take your mother to the doctors because her front bum's wrecked.
You know why?
Your mother's got a penis (C'mon Wembley)
Your mother's got a penis (Your mother's got a penis)
Your mother's got a penis
Your mother's got a penis (Put your hands in the air, Wembley)
That's right
Your mother's got a penis (Yes)
Your mother's got a penis (Wembley Arena, I can feel the electricity, see'mon !)
Your mother's got a penis
Your mother's got a penis
That's right
Your mother's got a penis
For the 18th week running, UK rap grounp the GLC hold the number one
position of the US billboard chart with another smash hit, Your Mother's Got A Penis.
Come 'ere boys, you ever seen a woman with a cock before?
Come yer, see'mon look at it. Bouncing up and down I'll stick it in you
Come yer, a woman with a cock. Tidy !
Yeah it's the truth man, his mother have actually got a penis."
21-onces,2005,goldie-lookin-chain,Hip-Hop,"I need to shift this draw quick as fuck
Flip the cash and take my cut
It's really powerful, it's so strong
But I'm selling it fast and it's nearly all gone
I'll sell you the 9-bar or just the ounce
I'll sell you little bits or large amounts
Adam Hussain, remember me?
Selling draw from my Capri
Want some draw? With me you'll score
Cos I grows this shit out o' my nan's back door
Bongs big as, blow buckets,
I sell like ounces to schoolkids but I don't care, fuck it
Get it on tick, but make it quick
I just got a load of wicked Thai stick
Party's going down, I'll bring the brown
Tonight it's going off in Newport town

I got 21 ounces of blow
I got 21 ounces of blow
So if you want some let me know, cos I really gotta go
I got 21 ounces of blow, blow, blow

I drive my Capri like Colin Macrae
And I gotta drop some weed off in Alway
I've got really good scales and my deals and my deals are proper
The prices is wicked too just like Happy Shopper
I sells the best skunk you tell by the smell
I'll also sell you fags and Rizlas as well
Oi, clart! Don't fuckin' start
Or I'll whip you with my chain and it'll fuckin' smart
Weed's green, like a frog

Cos the boot's rammed with Mary Jane
That's right, it's Benny Blanco
Selling the speed and the blow
Out of my car, cos that's how it's done
Pigs bust me twice and it got me on the run
Adam Hussain, I'm fuckin' GLC,
Cos if you wanted THC come see me
There's a new dance going on,
In Newport, it's called the funky bong
You wiggle your hips and start to show off
Breathe in and out and then you cough
You can only do it when you're smoking a cone
You can do it with your mates or all alone
Right to the left, left to the right
GLC and the funky bong, alright?
[Chorus]
I got 21 ounces of blow
I got 21 ounces of blow
So if you want some let me know, cos I really gotta go
I got 21 ounces of blow, blow, blow
Raw speed, whatever you need
Cos I've always got a big bag of weed
My shit ain't bunk, I sell skunk
Out of my low-ride Capri's trunk
Wanna gurn? You better learn
Your missus'll get free pills burping my worm
She's on all fours, wouldn't touch her with yours
Cos she looks like the wookie outta fuckin' Star Wars
I got 21 ounces of blow
I got 21 ounces of blow
So if you want some let me know, cos I really gotta go
I got 21 ounces of blow, blow, blow
I got 21 ounces of blow
I got 21 ounces of blow
So if you want some let me know, cos I really gotta go
I got 21 ounces of blow, blow, blow
You're not fuckin' CID, are you?"
manifesto-the,2005,goldie-lookin-chain,Hip-Hop,"Hey, lick the tip, why dont'cha
In 1983, a team of crack draw enthusiasts created a master plan.
A design for a way of livin' so revolutionary, so groundbreaking,
That its very concept posed a threat to the fabric of society.
A threat even greater than that of having a stiffy whilst standing
In the middle of a Glyn Williams' coach full of nuns.
The implications of this radical movements' political manifesto
Posed a threat to the UK authorities who in turn drove its founder
Members under ground."

With blood drippin' from my shoes
These lous coated in my heart
See dreamchasin' is a occupation
Those with the job understand the process and manifestation
A dream starts as a thought
And it's nurtured, achieved and sustained
Then we go back in our minds for more work
Let me out my cell
Right back on the mission
Fresh from off a bail
Right back in the kitchen

And I'm the only one they beat
I took one for the team

Who thought that I'd be cover of these magazines
Cause I be spittin' fire flow on kerosene
Lemme talk to em

Rich and Nay hit the kitchen then were pitchin' up
Rob base, Mase, Doug E Fresh switched it up
I do both who am I to fuck tradition up
So I parked in a tow-away zone, chrome
I don't care that car a throwaway homes
Welcome to Harlem
Where you welcome to problems
Off a furlo fella felons get parkings
Them niggas knew we bang
Stood out like Pootie Tang
Soon as the stoolie sang
That's when the toolie sang
Bang bang came from that movie rang
Snap crack jewelry bling
Flat jack who he bring
Clack clack cooley ring
Bad rap cuties claim
Ascap put 'em in the river

And you know my drift
Used to figures, doe and shit
You a rooster nigga
This a roaster bitch
And I roast ya bitch
That's how it usually end
Tell her and her groupie friends
Go get they Gucci cleanse
We the moody Gucci Louie and Pucci men
Or Skada Prada
The chopper it got the Uzi lens
Bird's eye view
The birds I knew
Flip birds

It was birds I flew
And word I blew

harlem-streets,2004,cam-ron,Hip-Hop,"Dipset man
Aye yo you know I've been all over
the motherfucking world man
But ain't no place like Harlem man
(Let) me break it down man
We tie dynamite to the rhino type
Whine you might find yo sight
Sell the information for a dime a white, that China China
I'm behind the diner, selling marijuana to a minor minor
Elder fella, lookin' for that shine, Ill shine ya
My mind design, you a dime, I dine ya
Madonna momma, body bottle, your fine, I'm finer
Time to climb her, climb behind vagina
Then I hime and grind her, 'til her mom remind her
Diamonds blind her, visions gone, kiss her palm
Turn her on, lift her arm, notice that her wrists is wrong
Gotta get it right ma, we gon get along
Said how don't trip, but yo the trick is wrong
First visit warn, day job tick a tron
Night time, missed the mom, bootleg Kris and Don
Brother Chris and Don, and they sister calm
They sell yay, you'll say yay, this shits the bomb
Im a hit my man, tell em you my bigga pawn
The rest, so yes, you'll be blessed to hit the intercom
You know kisses mom, she gave him wisdom charm
And they father come from a long list a dons
And I get it cheaper, I cop bricks like sneakers
And if the cops come, I just hit amnesia
But I give you an earful, it's tearful
Told my mother I hustle, and she said be careful
[Chorus]
Why I feel like I'm loosin' weight?
Why I ain't got no money? If I'm movin' weight
My life's based upon, what I'm a do this year
Cop a boat, hop a layer
Now the army suits cute wit my chocolate Airs
You ain't gotta stare, go cop a pair
Still the sweet in me, nothing they can do to me
I made sure my mother and girl, is smothered in pearls
When a nigga under the world
Everybody like Cam got the recipe now
Not them three girls I got to be Destiny's Child
Specially equities, wreckin' we smile
In the fear tech the tech and use the tech that we wile
The tech with the septa, receptive affiliates
Hectic, heckle a cock, Helicopters on the set of my sales
Nah, I ain't gon be embedded in jail
Talking to a cellmate in a bed in a jail, dog
I broke bread with the wheel, fled from some seals
And the house, I was the head of the hills, shit
You get a dumb ho, and get dumb happy
Go to the gun show, get gun happy
Stuck, killed, mugged, milt
Tone flint sticks, Bo, Chubs milk
Poochi, Baba, but got the hardest shells
We the Midwest gun cartel, nigga
Ya, well just clap up ya brains, snatch up ya chains
See dog ? rap is my aim
But I'm a hust-ul-a, in my heart, trapped is the game
A test of my frame, tapped to my brain, affects that remains
It wasn't rap, it was crack that got the racks on the Range
Look dog, don't be askin' for dames, see
Playboy, I don't own that man
In any way homeboy, you a grown ass man, shit
And when I rap it ain't no punchlines
I be on the highway dirty, crunch time
No timeouts homeboy, just one time
If they find that stash box, just one time?
Shit, they'll put the dogs in the trunk
Side of the road, holding you up, cold as a fuck
They want that button, lunge it and push it
Soon as they lunge it and push it, I run in the bushes
That's how I play mine, jump over the grapevine
Take my chances, one on one with the K9
Stealin' a clip, for anyone squealin' they lips
Fuck y'all if y'all ain't feeling the dips

Tell my niggas chill, but they want to heat the streets
Or do all the records, check it who spit beef to heat
Everybody welcoming this, welcoming that
He wasn't welcome in the first place, how we welcome him back?

Look at the Porsche he's in (look at it)
Then give them portioning (to who)
No handicap, Annie rag, orphan friends
Friends, but the sizzurp I'm drinking on

On probation, doe on house arrest (what up doe)
Right out the flesh sit in a house and rest
He don't pout, get him gear, in the house he fresh (fresh)
Not that you care, just getting clear and think
One glare and wink everyone wearing pink

I'm the reason that your ear rings is square yeah, hear)
Now we take trips to casinos, to lovely homes
You check on Lotti's mom, minos, honeycombs (homes)
You trying to fake it with card em, pardon
You gonna leave them naked like Tarzan
Kudo love know that too
Holler at Kudo, ask Nelly about him

Yo, yo, I kill diamonds, get with pearls
I ain't trying kid the world
I ain't got beef, when I do, I say get 'em girls
Not a diss dog (nope) we just heard the fronting (heard it)
Do Harlem a favor (what) get a church or something (something)
A rec center in the winter where the youth can play
They don't even shoot the jay sell drugs, shoot and spray

Two, that's two keys, I still move the yeah (ya,yo)
Found a newer way, my crew do and say
Fist fights to shoot outs, we won't move away

What you gonna do?
(I'm gonna tell you a story)
Yo, uh, I rock baguettes with hoodies, it's like extra goodie
I couldn't break dance ya'll, or electric boogie
I was obsessed with Cookie, I wanna sex her cookie
She said forget her nookie, wipe my nose, go get them boogies
I gave Cookie nookies, with the girls, got known
This my two brim hat, call me Sherlock Holmes
Whole world got blown, so I tell hoes
Fuck Lee's and shell toes, Dekangaroos and Velcro
Timbaland, mocassins, dimes in them pennyloafers
A-Train, one bus, sure I had plenty soldiers
Uncle, plenty holsters, dolgers, soldiers, hostess
Not golfin' like golf, he had plenty gophers
Can't get paid, the earth is big
You worthless kid, Cam don't deserve to live
Back then I played for douchos, went over the riverside
Young life, turned left, we back over the riverside
Blood played for stone gem
That's when I told him and Jim
We ain't ballin for real, where's the stone gems?
Where's the chrome rims?
That's when you changing lanes
Here we change your lane, we'll gain a sprain
Change the game
And not namin' names
But 'caine fames like Damon Wayans
Connect for life is, the Tech kept us righteous
'Cause yes expect the crisis, when it's connects and prices
I had to hustle harder, move up my mustle marger
Seen New Jack City, cop me a couple cars
And that's word to my father, send a bird to my father
Dove love, R.I.P. on his early departure
I'm just merely an author, but I'm purely a baller
Every Friday, across the street, and I creep with Ms. Parker

That nigga man, let me break it down real simple for ya'll
Listen, yo, and I'm very prestigous
You have various leases
All my pieces, painted them, cherry and peaches
Chics, Cherry and Peaches
They had cherry deheaters
If I want a toast, hustled up various reefer
Ithica, Ithica, hydro, why yo?
Haze on delivery, lives hoes, five fo
But kept the fo-five, for wise guys with eyes low
Pick me up from fo-five, CL-55, whoa!
Playin' Grand Theft Auto, they like Diablo
My crews' the triad, Zeke, Santana, Cop Co'!
But they some slimmy sue
Can rock a Jimmy Choo shoe
Next day Valore sweatsuit, construction timmy boots
Don't be no guinea boo, you rock that Fendi you
You drinkin' Henney too
Coupe Calez, when he boo
And he skinny too, they had my favorite rum
Not a six-fo-five-fo, but made in jump
Shout, say say the funk, he keep the K in pump
He ain't never scared, never scared, raise the trunk
We'll just lay and dump, play the punk, spray the chump
The way they runnin I guess they could relate to them

Maybe that's part of the reason
I feel like a boxer bobbin and weavin'
But I'm gettin' head, she's bobbin' and weavin' (yes sir)
I'm grabbin' her neck to stop her from breathin'
I'ma wild out until I part with my breathin'
Until I'm sparked out and leakin', part of the cement
I need something pure, like from the Garden of Eden (why)
Wouldn't mind making her part of my achievements (what happened)
Cause when music discourage my pride (who was there)
Zeke the only one with courage to ride
The ride's so dirty inside seems like we were playin' in mud
Hazin' it up, grams gave us the snub (she was buggin')
Who ill, a check for two mill
And a cheap case, defaced, blue still, true stills
I got stories that my soul can sing
Flip water like Poland Spring and I'ma hold them things
Look talk to 'em, Look my fella said you been coppin' a lot

It's about being 'bout it if you're not, you're ass backwards
My mathematics cause cash matters (that's important)

If the town's too hot, get up and leave
Niggas always got a trick up their sleeve (always)
Nigga like me I always got a brick up my sleeve and that's forever
Shit, I was two blocks from coppin' dust
I used to hop the bus, now look dog, ain't nobody hot as us
Girls, they gotta rush, shit, they gotta blush
Want to go in the mall just to shop with us
To how they piss and bitch how they ran a mile

Why all niggas play around, guns I wave around
Nigga better stay down, lay down, weigh pounds
Put 'em on the Greyhound, ride it up to K-Town(Sha Town)
The boy get nasty, To law enforcement blast me
Sawed-off and I'm happy, or where the crack be
Put it right all for Polaski
Cross street, don't need to be said
Code red I already got beef with the feds
Put three in ya head, from the street full of lead
Fuck knee-deep you'll be six feet when ya dead
Street sweeper when I creep creep, nigga fled (Philli, Philli)
When ya sleep sleep, nigga dead
Why you on the back block, fightin' in the crack spot
Jackpot, ask not yes why not
[Chorus: x2]
(It's your adrenaline rush)
Like when the motherfucka have to go and pick up the pump
To make his opposition chest kick up and jump
When you lit up the gun, to make ya body get up and uh
(It's your adrenaline rush)
Like when the motherfucka have to go and pick up the pump
To make the trigga pick up and dump
So turn the bass kick up the bump, and let the rhythm hit off the trunk
Ya bitch is a ho, she chill at the Rucker, you really a sucka
Big Will tryin' to grill her and cuff her
And Killa done fucked her, in love wit the chick, the slut was a fish
Threw her bait, reeled her in and gutted the bitch
And now she, up in Pokip's dick, huggin' the strip slick
Fifth tucked in her hip, she will mug you for kicks
And word to, mother I'm rich, hit ya mother with bricks
Cocoa why don't ya build buildings with concussion the bitch
Come and feel wit the balla who's the nicest and causin' the crisis
Got the ammo and agility that says rewind means growin' before
And this livin' and pause and this likeness
I can spit it for some who for nigga represent the call of the righteous
Or gang bang to the rhythm when I spit it
I'm a kill 'em wit the technical precision that'll be fuckin' up all the devices
Get sick wit it like I'm lit off the wet, if it's beef, get the shit off ya chest
Don't take off ya vest, all my niggas make you jump off the set
And always get the prints of the tech, straight off the deck
Mobbin' up and makin' niggaz duck, knowin' I'll still open up the trunk
Guns nigga we get 'em and bust
Murderin' the enemy is the ultimate adrenaline rush

I'm the king of things, and your man he a homo like jing-a-ling (jing-a-ling)
That's life, hit 'em with the pow-ping, pow, pow, .45 load thing
Look wild thing, I do wild things, make China stretch like Yoa Ming
Ching chong like a higher Chow Main, I buy lango ma, I don't need a nickel
Naw, oh you tickled ma? 'cause your nipples huh
Comin' through your shirt, nearly ripped your bra
[Chorus]
I see the hate in your eyes, damn them boys is too fly
The way we roll up, rims all swoll up, ice all froze up
And while you're actin' surprised, like we dough sellin' pies
They way we hold up, papi hole up, mami roll up
I know a school in work, but you need to schooled in work
Put my 2 to work, I feelin' your shoes, your purse
You get low on dough, the few the first
I don't need you high like I'm high, but shit, I need you fly like I'm fly
Fresh, Louis Vuitton ankle, Pastel, Louis Vuitton rainbow
Threw on the Kango, threw on Durango's
Not from the nati, but through on the Bengals
Moved on an angle, like a baller malodor the two gon' tango
Shake your body mami, move your body hottie
Its true on kamikaze, I'm movin' a Maserati
They all polly polly, voo boy dolly dolly, I don't talk like the swolly mami
I see the hate in your eyes, damn them boys is too fly
The way we roll up, rims all swoll up, ice all froze up
And while you're actin' surprised, like we dough sellin' pies
They way we hold up, papi hole up, mami roll up
Lady, dry your panties, damn, she want to right her family
Tell 'em Nad, I'm a dyper dandy and I got all type of candy
What's that Victoria Secret, here's Lapearla, come peep it
This lingerie that you could honor a wonder woman, oui, go on play
Like Cam' watch, like Cam' ring, like Cam' chain, like Cam bling
Heard Cam' sing, if a damn fling, goddamn mam', not a damn thing

get-down,2004,cam-ron,Hip-Hop,"Remember I'm a man of respect (remember)
Remember Santana was next
Now its not techs, its checks and fancy collects
I want his wrist, fist, whole had, jammed with baguettes
Pose for the camera man me and Santana man
Word to my grand ma he one bad mamma jamma, damn
So I don't write for the stardom
I get, booted, zooted, write down my problems
I've been through it headed right for the bottom
D.C. naw, would've been a sniper in Harlem (so what)
That's why I throw some doe to my cody from Kosovo
Help me get on overflow (shhh) no one suppose to know
But she lay me up like the prime minister
Thousand grams of dope smellin' like Hine Vinegar
That was a lot to linger, but to the top I bring her
But when it came to dope, I always copped in fingers
Money missin', oh shit I almost chopped some fingers
Slit some wrist, that's when they said oh shit he's not a singer
Fuck the rap, fuck the movies, fuck Siskel and Ebert
This pistol I'll squeeze it, missiles if needed (killa)
Remember I'm gonna spend my cake
Remember Jim we getting out of five eights (projects)
Now chefs will fry us steaks (that's true) it's a higher stake
Swiss accounts I'm goin' show you how to wire cake
And we from BBQ, now you a CEO, direct a video
Your own album here we go
That's my man anytime I holla, holla with me
We shared chicken sandwiches they was a $1.50
But you seven dollars, nickel bag and white owl
I hope the chicken sandwich last us through the night child
We ain't care we didn't sleep we was night owls
Insomniacs our life styles compatible
Magical pops gone, shit tragical
Mom's on mission, my house is where the attics chill
I'm like a teacher, I need me a sabbatical
Its not irrational, I grew up radical
And you all are shook, I bought all my crooks
Fuck you R&B; niggas Zeek sing all the hooks
Tito and Brick yes yes come again
They came sun or rain when I had that stomach pain (what else)"
bubble-music,2004,cam-ron,Hip-Hop,"Mami all on me cause I'm touchin' her belly
I'm on butter Pirelli's
Wit' purple and yellow, hello
That's butter and jelly
I flip butter on Celly's
All right in front of the deli
Holly, Lilly, to Kelly all spent once on the telly
(And what else) and I got hella gear
My earring is nice the price
Three town homes in Delaware
Uh tomato Porsche lookin' like tomato sauce
Hip hop hooray I got to get
That ya yo off
That's blocks to the ave, cops come blocking the
Ave, I put the glock in the stash
slabs and copped in the trash
Still stop and I laugh, ma put
Them rock in your ass, the rest

Play you for what
You gon' play yourself
Ain't nobody gon' pay you like you pay yourself
And my weight of the wealth was SK, AK, mayday, payday dog
Don't play with your health

Mami she open she open,jump off hopin' I'm hopin'

Oral choke em' and choke em'
I flip bundle to bundle, tryin' to double my double
at the same time for what but the cops say I'm
I get fresh from
Yankee stadium to the garden I beg your pardon
Stop it, my closet, Macy's men's department
Pants, shirt, scarf, phone if you check it
Get the scoop on the cologne, belt, and shoe section
Fur for fur baby, baby you'll go stir crazy
Got that David Yurmen burnin', the bird gazey
You'll get hurt play me, burp let the dirt chase me
Every third lady that flirt, want my chirp lately I know
Some RNs that still strip, when I and this real dick, in
The clinic, no student can heal shit
Better than college, after that, students home
At least after your bid, ain't no student loans
To pay back, jack, ask what do you condone
Hit towns wit coke, a 45 blue as chrome
Now they done juiced Marone, knock, knock are you at home
I'm a call he, girls call the crib
And ask are you alone Killa
[Chorus]
We race foreign cars, custom models, drop top mustard Tahoe
We like the musketeers, trained by cus d'amato
Just a model, a dozen hollows is tough to swallow
Watch Sanford in son I'm like the buzz in rollo
Afourtuniado, the Porsche Apollo, wars a follow
Got the mack jack, still swing swords like Zorro
We jackin' and clappin' y'all just applaud like bravo
Now I plaud the Cappo, Zeke and Santana
I don't razor wrist's, I keep eighths of piff
The games and the chick like kobe I'm a rape the bitch
Razor grips, laser spit, Glock cocked J or fifth
D on the block just like Jada Kiss
Haters shift, plead the fifth, spray

como tambien el sudor de un padre
por el esfuerzo de traer comida a su casa
y pensar que casi siempre se atrasa
en dar a su familia alimento
y aunque nunca les pase pasa
cuando llega
llega contento
aqui lo que nace
doy fe que aqui se muere
una cadena
todo enlase
donde la traicion no nos vuelve
y si con sulavio
un hombre traiciona un secreto
el barrio campea con su respeto
donde el silencio siempre fiel
asu decrepo cumple

por el cual yo vivo
por lo cual prometo

Boricuoso, tÃº sabes.
TÃº sabes que yo iba caminando por la calle why choquÃ© con Esmeralda
Que era la perla del barrio
Su madre se llamaba Manuela why su hermana Carola.
Cuando la vÃ­
FuÃ© una vista hermosa
Why fuÃ­ corriendo al campo alegre
Recogiendo lirios, lauleres, gladiolas, amapolas, margaritas, magnolias,
En el monte,
A lado de un lago, why al otro lado manantiales,
Hice un ramo para llevarle a ella why a su familia
Para que despuÃ©s sembrara las flores en su jardines.
Bajando del camino
Me fijÃ© en las casas de su familia
Eran bien humildes
La de ella hasta tenÃ­a una puerta de tierra,
Pero no me molestaba el polvorÃ­n
Why si derepente me enfermara
LlamarÃ­a al doctor Pila
Que vive en tremenda villa
Para que me diera un buen consejo
No me podia tardar,
Por que estaba mi socio el coto como guaraguau
Merodeando detrÃ¡s de ella,
Pero cuando sintiÃ³ brisa why aroma de tantas flores como la de una rosaleda se emocionÃ³,
Why yo me sentÃ­ como un hombre ilustre,
Como Barbosa, Lloren, Virgilio,
Canales, Lopez why Cardon why Gaudiel,
EntrÃ© por la puerta why le dije ... Cierra linda !
Pues de momento pensÃ© que podria tener con ella una buena aventura,
Pero ella me dijo nÃ³.
Primero me tienes que llevar a viajar el mundo,
Si me llevas a Venezuela, Israel, Shangai, VietnÃ¡m why hasta los Altos de Cuba,
Puede ser que te de un cariÃ±ito especial,
Pero no te prometo nada.
Era cara la muchacha,
Pero como yo no tenia dinero
La convencÃ­ why la lleve a una playita
Why cuando se quitÃ³ el traje de baÃ±o
Para yo no hablar malo dije
CataÃ±o muchacha que cuerpazo !
Me quede como el mirador,
Admirando su belleza,
Why me puso la punta brava
Why rapido tire una sabana abajo, en la arena,
Why en el cruce de palabras
Llega Barton why Galateo,
Why en mi mente empiezo bajar los santos del cielo,
BajÃ© a San Isidro a San Jose a San Fernando, San Antonio, Santa Elena why hasta Santa Teresita,
Why les dije que es lo que quieren?
Why me dijieron: Vamos a pescar el sabor aquÃ©l en el rio plantation.
Why yo para no mandarlos para buen sitio
Los mandÃ© para un tumbo.
Esmeralda, Torrez,
Por que asÃ­ era que llamaba se querÃ­a ir porque estaba molesta,
Pero yo la invite a mi casa blanca
Como las de las colectoras de piedra, las pomas,
Tu sabes, de esas casitas asÃ­.
Situada en una cantera
Contruida por mi mismo
Pues del barrio obrero soy
Adornada com murales del sem why de borinquen

Tomo la lea pa' prender ese fogn
Corre mi nia, acelera, mete el chambn

Canto'e fresca, te gusta ir de pesca
Buscando caa pero de la gigantesca
Mas duro, entonces yo te vacuno
Tan sencillo como el uno por uno

Tu padre y tu madre contigo botaron la bola...

Sacude el bumper duro, y la tablilla
Pulia acero que me dobla la varilla
Que? Activao' hasta botar la polilla
Es que en la disco es que mi gata coge vuelo
(Hey!) Le gusta que la besen por el cuello
(Hey!) Sus besos saben a caramelo
Y si nos vamos pa'l duelo
Yo la atropello

Al incordio majadero del flow que da castigo
No se duerman, suben de afuera por la orilla de la arena

salud-y-vida,2004,daddy-yankee,Hip-Hop,"Que dios te multiplique lo que me deseas
Yo tengo la salud pa' enfrentar la mala marea
Donde tengo los pies mucho me quieren ver la cabeza
En esta selva de cemento fiera por naturaleza
Pero al gran caballo grandes espuelas
No le tengo miedo a los grandes problemas
Pero por dinero si honradamente me lo gano yo prefiero
Ser dueÃ±o de un peso que ser esclavo de rot (you know)
Es que se venden, entienden que hasta los ojos marrones
Cuando los ven cambian a verde
Favor con favor se paga
Si en este tiempo que vivimos ni el agua sale de gratis
Dar pa' recibir no es dar sino pedir, buscando un tubo en el piso
PodrÃ­a encontrar el fin
EstarÃ© pidiendo mucho con un poco 'e lealtad
No me hable de confianza a caso se olvidaron que
Un santo era san pedro y nego a su maestro
Un santo era san pedro y nego a su maestro
Con dinero, sin dinero siempre yo hago lo que quiero
Vivo por mi propia ley, sin corona soy un rey
Con el pan necesario que hicieron yo doy gratitud
De que me pare ser un millonario y no tener salud
Aja de que te vale trabajar como un animal
y cuando te despiertes en la sala de un hospital
De que te vale ser cruel dime, si tu eres el mismo diablo
Yo serÃ© tu san Miguel
Cuanto habladores no se que cuando su boca abren
Con la lengua nadaran en un charco de sangre
No pongas en tela de juicio la hombrÃ­a de nadie
Porque a quien le gusta quedar como un cobarde
Pero si quieren la victoria los ignorara
Perdiendo a veces en la vida uno gana mas
1 a 1 ellos caerÃ¡n y despuÃ©s te llamaran
Tus sabios perdonaran desconfiando al igual porque
Un santo era san pedro y nego a su maestro
Un santo era san pedro y nego a su maestro
Bien aventurado el que aborrece la envidia pues va a tener salud y vida
Sembrando el odio en mi alma no encontrare salud y vida
Por eso es que a mis enemigos yo pido deseÃ¡ndoles salud y vida
No te afanes en matarme mi hermano desÃ©ame salud y vida
Nazareno te doy gracias porque tu me dejas tener salud y vida
El tesoro mas preciado es caminar siempre lleno de salud y vida
La piedra en mi camino se alegrara si fuera perder salud y vida

Yo hago lo que sea pa saber su nombre
Una chica como esa no se deja ir
Pero ya veo que el so esta saliendo
Y adonde ella vaya la voy a seguir
To su ante maÃ±as me estÃ¡n seduciendo
Ella tira lo ready y yo solo cai
Dime tu nombre y tu numero de telÃ©fono
Dime adonde vives y tu casa, baby let me know
Dime con razÃ³n que tu no me das a mi el cÃ³digo
Sin prueba desde entonces vas a cedarte
Yo soy tu rifle y tu eres la bala que dio mi corazon
Para que me mates con ese cuerpo ta solito
Para que la llenes el amor todo es
Sin prueba deste entonces vas a cedarte
Como dije yo!
Ahora me tocas darte un nudo apretao
Chica vamonos!
Para que bailes conmigo este guallaco

Nadie aquÃ­ lo baila como lo haces tu
Nadie a qui lo mueves como lo haces tu
Nadie aquÃ­ lo vate como lo haces tu
Yo se la pregunta ante que la vayas a hacer
Si tengo una gata conmigo y con otra mujer
Que le digo lo mismo a todas la que yo conozco
Pero e la primera que me saca a mi de foco
Sino es real sino interesada, tu te fueras
Si conoce no somos como do almas hemelas
La decisiÃ³n esta en ti para que me compruebes
Pero recuerdas que tiempo que se vas no vuelves
Como dije yo!

Y lleva agujas en el pecho
Miles bravos como tu
Los he visto cagando pelo
Manso como paloma, Astuto como serpiente pa'
AsÃ­ navego yo en la isla de la muerte
You know me man, daddy yankee alias el cangri men
Con un record bendecido amÃ©n
De 6 producciones, 70 apariciones
Promedio sin igual de 130 canciones
Veterano que por nadie se deja vencer
Con un flow que parece que saci cantando ayer
AcÃ©ptalo, suelta el micrÃ³fono
Si tu eres un caballo, yo soy el dueÃ±o del hipÃ³dromo
Comandante que manda en el auditorio
El chef de la clinica en el laboratorio
100 gramos de intelecto, nieve pa' la candela
Fuego e hielo pa' la estufa, puÃ±o, lÃ¡piz a la libreta
Sacando el material puro pa' la carretera
Barrio Fino, el cuco de parar tus ventas
No importa lo que eres ni lo grande que tu seas
Los postes son mas grandes y los perros los mean
Santifica tus escapularios

Farfulleros como tu

He visto moretones caballero acepten
(Que no hay nadie ya) quitate tu pa' ponerme yo
Papi, por que razÃ³n tu me tienes tanto odio
Es que le estoy sacando el jugo a este negocio
No compares un fajÃ³n con un tipo que es un vago
La mierda que usted se come yo no soy el que la cago
Hasta donde llega la maldad de ustedes
No pueden ver que alguien a su la'o progrese
Pero durmiendo tuve esta Ãºnica visiÃ³n
Que estaba yo, taba tu hermano
El negro halcÃ³n meciÃ©ndome en un gran sillÃ³n
Jugando con mis nieto en una casa de un millÃ³n
Duro como coco sin necesidad de bastÃ³n (aja!)
Y usted pela'o orinÃ¡ndose en un colchÃ³n
Tampoco yo me creo ser la octava maravilla
Ni que soy de hierro, intocable, y con sangre amarilla
No prego no tener la super babilla pero
(Tu valentÃ­a depende de una pastilla)
Que malo es ver un cobarde con poder
Son capaces de mandar pero no se saben valer
Aunque miles se afanen por parar todos mis planes
Quien va a cerrar la puerta que dios abre
Santifica tus escapularios
(Te visita el cangriman) quÃ­tate tu pa' ponerme yo
Farfulleros como tu

corazones,2004,daddy-yankee,Hip-Hop,"Si las miradas mataran to el tiempo usara una gavana
Un cura me acompaÃ±ara siguiÃ©ndome en una caravana
Si fuera por mis enemigos a la mesa me trairian una vÃ­bora
De carne y vinagre de bebida
Me crucificaran en un acto crudo homicida
Pero se equivocan me levanta mi dios con salud y vida
Si por el gobierno fuera los raperos no existieran
Nos lanzaran al calabozo y con la pena de muerte nos dieran
Esta el que pisotea y el que ayuda al ser humano
Existe el buen amigo que es leal como un hermano
La sangre pesa mas que el agua pero midela bien
Existe sangre sucia fÃ­jate caÃ­n y abel
Porque hay corazones con en-vi-dia
Corazones con ira
Corazones con furia
Situaciones de millones corazones
Con miedo
Corazones sin-ceros
Corazones gue-rreros
Corazones trai-cio-neros
Soy de la capital del crimen y en el aire se percibe un espÃ­ritu
De muerte que devora lo que vive, si fuera por mi reunirÃ­a a
Todos los caserÃ­os proponiendo una tregua en nombre de los
Que se han ido (sin miedo!)
Yo les dirÃ­a mi gente yo solo aquÃ­ soy un valiente que les pide
Que no derramen ya la sangre inocente arreglen como hombres
Y no se fallen mutuamente, pero se que es un sueÃ±o perdido como
Ver a los 3 partidos unidos luchando por el bien de puerto rico
No ven que es mediocre la educaciÃ³n en los residenciales necesitan
Mas maestros necesitan materiales, para crear mas lideres
Y menos criminales (hay corazones allÃ­ con problemas personales)
Si por mi fuera le darÃ­a para atrÃ¡s al tiempo sanarÃ­as las heridas
Que marcaron todo su cuerpo, paraba las manos de aquel centuriÃ³n
Con su lanza tambiÃ©n en el acto me tendrÃ­an que dar matanza
Lo bajarÃ­a de la cruz estando moribundo pero tuvo que morir para
Salvar al mundo
Porque hay corazones con en-vi-dia
Corazones con ira
Corazones con furia
Situaciones de millones corazones
Con miedo
Corazones sin-ceros
Corazones gue-rreros
Corazones trai-cio-neros
Porque hay corazones con en-vi-dia
Corazones con ira
Corazones con furia
Situaciones de millones corazones
Con miedo
Corazones sin-ceros
Corazones gue-rreros
Corazones trai-cio-neros
Es que en el mundo hay corazones que se creen sabios en su propia opiniÃ³n
Pero cabe su fin porque andan en caminos de perdiciÃ³n, hay corazones que no
Perdonan a sus hermanos pero tu sabes que asÃ­ mismo dios no los perdonara
Por sus pecados, hay corazones que ayudan sin pedir nada a cambio y por su
Nobleza encuentran el progreso a diario, hay corazones traicioneros que le gusta
EngaÃ±ar a los corazones sinceros pero mas vale el segundo que el dinero de el
Mundo entero, y existe aquel corazon maligno que nos atormenta como Ã¡ngeles
Caidos pero hay un corazon mas poderoso que nos protege que jamas y nunca
Sera vencido y el que lo busque y lo encuentre para siempre sera bendecido

Dang, I know, I know
But it's, it's just some things I gotta get off chest, alright?
Yeah, woo, ooo, woo, ooo, woo, ooo
Listen
Baby, come here and sit down
Let's talk; I got alot to say
So I guess I'll start by sayin' that I love you
But you know this thing ain't been a walk in the park (for us)
I swear it'll only take a minute
You'll understand when I finish, yeah
And I don't want to see you cry
But I don't want to be the one to tell you a lie, so
How do you let go when you
You just don't know what's on
The other side of the door?
When you're walking out, talk about it, and
Everything I tried to remember to say
Just went out my head
So I'm a do the best I can to get you to understand
Cause I know!!
There's never a right time to say goodbye
But I gotta make the first move
Cause if I don't, you gonna start hating me
Cause I really don't feel the way I once felt about you
Girl, it's not you, it's me
I, I gotta, gotta figure out what I need, oh
There's never a right time to say goodbye
But we know that we gotta go
Our separate ways
And I know it's hard, but we gotta do it
It's kind of killing me
Cause there's never a right time
A right time to say goodbye
Girl, I know your heart is breaking
And a thousand times I
Found myself asking, ""Why? Why?""
Why am I taking so long to say this?
But trust me, girl, I never
Meant to crush your world
And I never thought I would see the day we'd grow apart
And I wanna know...
How do you let go when you
You just don't know what's on
The other side of the door?
When you're walking out, talk about
Girl, I hope you understand
What I'm tryna say
We just can't go on
Pretending that we get along
Girl, how you not gonna see that I'm hurt?
There's never a right time to say goodbye
But I gotta make the first move
Cause if I don't, you gonna start hating me
Cause I really don't feel the way I once felt about you
Girl, it's not you, it's me

There's never a right time to say goodbye
But we know that we gotta go
Our separate ways
And I know it's hard, but we gotta do it
It's kind of killing me
Cause there's never a right time
A right time to say goodbye
Listen to your heart
Girl, you know
We should be apart, baby
I, I just can't do it
I, I just can't do it
Listen to your heart
Girl, you know
We should be apart, baby
I, I just can't do it
And sometimes it makes me wanna cry
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Do you hear me crying?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Some of them so hood

They all go crazy over me
Don't matter what part of the world
Girls want to be part of my world
Look, I done had my share
Bringin' round me, is a bad idea
I take Big or small, short or tall
Light or dark, I try them all
'Cause I like
From stupido groupie hoes
To one of these r&b; group skio's
I need a slick mouth, thick south, brickhouse
Or I may date, a-rate playmate
Ten in the face, thin in the waist
Tight in the thighs, light in the eyes
Even those
Who think they the shit
I keep my
Walkin' on pedicured paws
Touchin' wit' manicured claws
If you waxed down, and tanned up
Then let me see ya hands up
Now

I like my
In four inch Christian Laboutins
Lips made for kissin' and poutin' I like my
Fat butt, flat gut, and that strut. to drive cat nuts

Them Natural born fraks, wit blonde streaks
Seven's on cheeks
My nothin'less than a dime piece
Pink face cartier time piece

Wit' tits that'll bust out tops

Still know how to be nasty
Like my
Wit' no laws, no flaws
No bra's and no drwaws'
Those yours

From the Asian to the Malaysian
I even had the Bahian to the Caucasian
I spend most the weekend
Wit' pretty Puerto and Costa Rican
Then again, I love Dominicians
And might be stylin' wit' a Italian
I be shakin for a Jamaican and Haitian
And take by the million if they they Brazilian
I'm sailin' wit' a Australian
Or trafficin' wit' the south African
Panamaian or Grenadian
You know I cross the border for a Canadian
I need a miss that's Swiss, a freak that's Greek
Or distinguished English
I fly in for a Hawaiian

Yo
Baby Girl where you at ?
[Lil Mo]
Right here
Right here
right here baby
Here's another one
[Fabolous]
You need to holla at somebody real such as myself
Won't nobody do as much as myself
And its so real ill hop out and get the dutches myself
For a pretty girl as such as yaself
'cause ima busy man I don't see too much for myself
And sometimes it be hard to get in touch with myself
But I, make the time when I have to
Learn to take my time and be careful when dealing wit women
There's some who be willing and skimming
And dive in to relationships 'cause I got a million to swim in
They'll throw it to you faster than schilling and clemens
But feelings ain't the only thing that you can catch now
Some throw lawyers that you hoping they fetch thous
Others pass diseases that you can catch now
But in my minutes so lone I think about this crazy world
And.. I don't want to live in it alone
Come on
[Chorus: Lil Mo]
Ill give you all my love
And you can always trust
My loyalty, honesty, and security (and i'll never)
Ill never leave (no, no, no)
Can none of these other chicks fuck wit me
So holla at somebody real (cause i)
'cause I'm so real
[Fabolous]
(real love) I'm searching for a real love like j blige in 92
but I pray I will find you
And say whether the storm will leave the gray skies behind you
The fake may try to blind you
That's why I stay fly like I do
And no I can trust everybody that I say hi and bye to
First I need a girl that may die as my boo
Then I may try the I do's
But, I refuse to be trick
Or used by a chick
Who gets amusement of kicks
Out of abusing my dick
When its real I'm all in it
But I don't want the scars of love that you get when you fall in it
(no) before it didn't matter who
Now I look for some with a little attitude
I could chitter chatter to, good looking
But witty and compatible
Long hair wit a fatty too
And that'll do
[Chorus:]
[Lil Mo]
No I'm not trying to pressure you
But my loves to incredible
For to waste
In front of your face
Then I give you something you can feel
To let you know your hollering at somebody real
[Fabolous]
I need to holla at somebody real could that be you
The feelings that I feel could that be true
Most cats lay where the hood rats be boo
But I'm the kinda cat that strays away
That's til somebody real sways my way
Then I might spend some days always
On a Asia bay
Eating food made the Cajun way
And sippin ga lil saki
Blowing a lil brocoli
But this world is full of fluzi's
And bullshit usually
I pull I'm choosy
And on this joint and at this point
I know I need to holla at somebody real
For real

And why would I, and why should I
When I seen a lady tonight, with my good eye that I would try and make
My..(baby..baby)
I was up in the club putting my hood high
When I saw you, and I stood by
Just lookin at your onion girl I could cry, and I could lie
I mean I could try and say you ain't sweep me off my feet
But only one thing could keep me off the street
And that's if you be my, B-A-B-Y
I can be why you always be fly
And I'm from B-Stuy, just like B.I...G. was, that's how F-A-B does
We can sip something 'til we both be buzzed
In a V-dub and that's only be-cause

Need someone to be my (baby)
Kind of girl you find in the club rockin those (baby) Phat jeans
Gonna find someone to be my (baby)

After the baby talk, the goo goo ga ga
You like this, that, you do bla bla
Couple good jokes, a few brouhaha's, it's time to do you mama
First I'ma put you on your back
And make you scream out (baby)..just like I put you on the track
Then I'ma lay you on your side
And slowly stroke you while you telling me the way you feel inside
But my sex drive won't make me play you on the side
You know you get the keys any day you wanna ride
And my baby know how to start me up
You got the kind of kiss that'll speed a heartbeat up
And you got the kind of touch that'll gimme the chills
I ask you 'cause I know you gonna gimme it real
It won't be fake, and don't we make a good couple
And won't we make a good...(baby)?

But you're so amazing
I just want us to do this exclusively
Say you'll be my baby

My baby's the only one I bring to the villa
That can get the bling and the scrilla
Girl, I know you smooth enough to spring a chinchilla
And still take a sting of Tequila, the way you swing is a thriller
I'm watchin that like the boxing match in the ring of Manila
I wanna keep it comin like the singles of ""Thriller""

And know who I be
I got the Yankee leaning, just sittin' over to browse
And the G4 is just getting over the clouds
You can't tell me that I ain't what's up right now
I got a bottle of Tequila upside down
There's some chicks wit' boyfriends that are up tight now
'Cause they know the big dog had a pups like wow
I'm stuck in my city ways
Heading over seas wit' a zip of New York City's haze
You rats can keep running through your city's maze
Until you get sprayed with the pesticide
I know you in that hole, you best to hide
Like the rest who tried, who went and testified
Of course your girl wanna slide over and be rubbed
And don't mind taking rides over the G dubs
I ride Rovers on Spre-dubs
Please don't be another dude who died over a ski dub, chill
From hood to hood they see what's hood and know who I be
From block to block they see it, not can't know who I be
From state to state they cannot hate, they know who I be
From the east to west, through the Midwest and down south
It's ghetto, it's ghetto
It's ghetto, it's ghetto
It's ghetto, it's ghetto
It's ghetto, it's ghetto
It's ghetto
I get it jumping like a lo lo '64
And bet they hop on it like a pogo stick pro
I'm chilling wit these go go chicks though
That do the kind of things that belong in a porno flick yo
You know it's him and the gang
Wit' the bling worked on that remind you of lemon meringue
But remember the thangs, ain't too far
And y'all wanna hear 'em go bang, bang, bang
Like John Witherspoon, I'm watching 'em closely
I know the snakes gonna slither soon
The two toned Maybach's getting delivered soon
The back feels like sitting in the living room
I'm so hard bodied like the suit on Batman
It's that man that back to back plat' scan
I'm back for the third time, I make words rhyme for a living
You probably heard I'm still ghetto, nigga
From hood to hood they see what's hood and know who I be
From block to block they see it, not can't know who I be
From state to state they cannot hate, they know who I be
From the east to west, through the Midwest and down south
It's ghetto, it's ghetto
It's ghetto, it's ghetto
It's ghetto, it's ghetto
It's ghetto, it's ghetto
They tried to put two 9's on me, just like Gretzky
But my lawyer saw through it just like wet tees
I smoke till my eyes look just like Jet Li's
On islands where the water's blue just like Pepsi
Yeah, the trigger just might get squeezed
And the slugs will skip over your waves, just like jet skis
Hoes know Ghetto from New York, call 'em the Fresh Prince
And throw rose petals when I walk
They love how I came back hard like good blow
And I'm still a heart throb to a hood ho
That's what hood though, yes I would know
That's 'cause I'm in the streets like man hole covers
Rims look like blades when a fan blow brother
I'm waiting on a storm to land, roast others
The man no other, 'cause I been in it
My time is money, y'all couldn't buy ten minutes
I'm gone catch up
From hood to hood they see what's hood and know who I be
From block to block they see it, not can't know who I be
From state to state they cannot hate, they know who I be
From the east to west, through the Midwest and down south
It's ghetto, it's ghetto
It's ghetto, it's ghetto
It's ghetto, it's ghetto
It's ghetto, it's ghetto
It's ghetto"

On them streets
You better keep your hand on them heats
And live what you sayin' on them beats
Real talk..
They ain't walkin' the walk, they just talkin' the talk
Some people look at me as the real talk of New York
I ain't these like these niggaz who be feinin' to front
Like they the first to ever put green in a blunt
Look I don't be meaning to stunt, but I zip down like jeans in the front
In somethin' that you seen and you want
But otherwise I'm cool wit' it
They say only the ones who never had gon' get and act a fool wit' it
Everybody's gangsta through the promotion
Even if they raised in a house wit' a view of the ocean
The bangers is growin' upset
'cause' ya' ass is on t.v. throwin' up sets
And you know you ain't like that
But you'll say that you is
Go and rent a bunch a shit and and then say that its his
You ain't a pimp or you wouldn't go to dinner wit' groupies
Ain't a baller 'cause' you wouldn't put spinners on hoopties
[Hook: x 2]
1-2-3; you don't really want to fuck wit me
Get in the way you could get yourself shot
Fuck the cops, you on my block
Fuckin' wit a gangsta nigga
How can niggaz say they be on the other side of the seas'
Where the steering wheels are on the other side of the v's
And the home look like the spot on the other side of the see's
When they ain't never been on the other side of the p's
I ca' see through em', ya tents are too light
Every sentence you write is far from the truth
You want to be that nigga you are in the booth
But you ain't got the heart, the scars, or the proof
And now you flash ya' shirt tag in our grill
But I'm hearin' you was a dirtbag before the deal
You walk around talkin' how every dime sucked
When they don't even speak to you, nevermind fucked you
Ya' hood sayin' don't come back
Step foot in here, and they gon' put you where you won't come back
Dog, how the fuck you gon' have keys in ya' house
When ya' moms' won't even give you keys to the house loser
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
Nigga you in the mirror, checkin' what your make ups' lookin' like
Tryina fool the world wit' a Jacob look-a-like
Jiving like you hold stacks
But ya' car is ten years old homie, ya' drivin' in a throwback
They gon' strip you, have you runnin' naked next
Without security you like unprotected sex
You ain't never gon' finger a trigger
All you do is look in the mugshot book and finger a nigga
I real recognize real, you'd be a john doe
You livin' in a closet and call it a condo
I don't member you as a slinger that was on the bench
Just a little scrub ass ringer in the tournaments
Now they try to blame the fall of hip hop on fans
Nah, I think its these hip hop con mans
Studio gangstas is played out now
This ain't the eighties, battle raps'll get you laid out
Fucker
[Hook]
1-2-3; and any time that you on them streets
You better keep your hand on them heats
And live what you sayin' on them beats
Real talk
Real talk
It's really really really really real talk
It's really really really really real talk
It's really really really really real talk
It's really really really really real talk"

Hurry up girl if you wanna get some
Hurry up girl if you wanna get some
Hurry up girl if you wanna get some
Hurry up girl if you wanna get some
[Verse One: Fabolous]
Ma you better off coming with a Anna Nicole plan, tryna get ya hand on a old man
Maybe he's plannin' to romance, hand you a gold band and spend a couple grand on a po dance
...When it comes to splurgin chips, I'm tighter than virgin lips
If there's some who like to trick, who like a chick
And +come out the pocket like Michael Vick+
Or some who want a patient man
....or go with a payment plan
...wanna go to department stores
Then they want the keys to your apartment door
Nowadays a girl'll come with a price tag
And give it up for nice shoes and a nice bag
+they must have bumped their head, give them an ice bag+
And I ain't thirst, but show em.....
[Chorus: Fabolous]
All I got is hard dick and bubble gum
And guess what, I'm fresh out of bubble gum
But I happen to have a whole lotta dick and a whole lotta chicks
Who wanna get sum
Hurry up if you wanna get some
Hurry up girl if you wanna get some
Hurry up girl if you wanna get some
Hurry up girl if you wanna get some
[Verse Two: Fabolous]
Now a chick who gold dig, look for a nigga who roll big
Rather than a nigga who hold gigs
Unless you bring her what you bringin home
Keep her finger with the bling and chrome
She try ta cling on everything you own
Even singin on them ringin tones
I rather be single and swing alone
+before you do me like ginger did sam+
+they catch you if they can like the ginger bread man+
But I know it's all about the benjamins mam
And maybe another man responds to you
At the most I could get you in the ???
Cause I'm not interested in buyin a chick
But you can call me about tryin ta dick
1-800-GIT-SUM....
.......
....
[Chorus: Fabolous]
All I got is hard dick and bubble gum
And guess what, I'm fresh out of bubble gum
But I happen to have a whole lotta dick and a whole lotta chicks
Who wanna get sum
Hurry up if you wanna get some
Hurry up girl if you wanna get some
Hurry up girl if you wanna get some
Hurry up girl if you wanna get some
that's right I'm gettin money, and you ain't gon git it from me

[Verse Three: Fabolous]
Most of them frontin like players, they nothin but haters

They suckin up nuts like the elephant yo
After one night stands, you hadn't seen them since
Till they came to court ??? ???? ?? ??? ?? ?
Now a diamonds be a flawless ???

And by tha expressions on them hotties grills
I know they wanna holla at somebody real
And I'm usually lookin' for somebody skilled
Enough to make a nigga say aye aye aye yo niggas get mad 'cause I may slay they hoe
But I don't wanna let the a.k. spray so
Stop face fightin' me, like ya face frighten' me
I do this every year so I ain't never scared
I do this everywhere and you ain't never there
They sayin' this everywhere, how could you never hear

If you wanna roll with tha thugs tonight
Lights, camera, action can you feel tha hype

don-t-stop-won-t-stop,2004,fabolous,Hip-Hop,"It's been a year and some change
And I've been hearin' some things
That there's some motherfuckers tryin' to be me
But ain't none of these motherfuckers tryin' to see me
So I won't stop, and I don't stop, yeah
It's like everywhere I look and everywhere I go
I'm hearin' muh'fucka's tryin'a steal my flow
But it ain't no thing cause see my nigga J.O
Put me up on the game when I stepped through the do'
Now I done been so many places and seen so many faces
But none of these motherfuckers do it like me
Don't no motherfuckin' click do it like we
Guess I'm doin' the right thing like Spike Lee
See they talk like they some ho's, I walk like I'm supposed
But if they get in the way they get stepped on
It's the hundred-thou with the bling kept on
Dippin' on my semi-automatic weap-on
I ain't playin' no games, and I ain't sayin' no names
Nigga put the shoes on if they fit you
Well there's two things that I'm gon' admit to
That I won't stop, and I don't stop
[Chorus:]
It don't stop
And it won't stop
And it don't stop
It don't stop, it won't stop
It don't stop
And it won't stop
And it don't stop
It don't stop, it won't stop
I take whatever come wit the wealth, and even humble myself
But I ain't the kinda nigga you can style on
I got a coupe that I'm finna' put some miles on
And I ride on these niggaz wit a smile on
See I'm 'bout stackin' money but when they start actin' funny
I fall back and all a man do is laugh
I'm the kinda player that ain't gotta do the draft
Buncha hits, couple plaques nigga do the math
But a nigga must be gone for gettin' his hustle on
So I had to come through and take the corner back
And I'm back wit the rubber bands on a stack
Nigga quit or take what I give on a pack
Girls still think I'm fly
Blow kiss and wink the eye
And tell me they want to go somewhere and freak off
I tell 'em I would love to stop and take the week off
But I won't stop, and I don't stop
[Chorus:]
I listen to niggaz flippin' my lines
And be grippin' my nine
Like damn niggaz flip and only spit game
Niggaz comin' at me tryin' to get names
Niggaz lookin like me tryin' to get fame
See first it didn't matter, and I was a little flattered
But now these young boys they gettin' too grown
Like I ain't show 'em how to rock jewels two toned
But it won't stop, and it don't stop
Yeah
[Chorus:]
It's like everywhere I look and everywhere I go
I'm hearin' muh'fucka's tryin'a steal my flow

can-you-hear-me,2004,fabolous,Hip-Hop,"[Chorus]
'cause now I ain't wit cha, know that I miss ya, some how I carry on
I can still picture, when I was wit cha like you was never gone
I remember the good times, all of the bad times
I dedicate this song, to my niggaz laid out, Til my niggaz lay down
Can Ya Hear Me, I know you hear me
[Fabolous]
Now we was once two niggaz of the same kind
Quick to holla at a bitch with the same lines
Quick to draw on a nigga with the same nines
But at the same time we was on some different shit
'cause you was with a bitch that I beg to differ wit
I told you sniff a bit and you could get a whif of it
But you kept a closed nose when it came to those hoes
And I'm your nigga so I tried to smell em wrong for ya
Wasn't there to take the fault for ya, But if you hear me
I dedicate this song for ya, He was setup in a stick up
By a girl he used to pick up on the upper west side
I used to help him chop a brick up, They found him in his pickup
Pants down and dick up, Leanin with one in his head
And one in his chest, One of the best at this husslin' shit
But his downfall was that he put his trust in a bitch and it's fucked up
[Chorus]
'cause now I ain't wit cha, know that I miss ya, some how I carry on
I can still picture, when I was wit cha like you was never gone
I remember the good times, all of the bad times
I dedicate this song, to my niggaz laid out, Til my niggaz lay down
Can Ya Hear Me, I know you hear me
[Fabolous]
I remember selling three bricks of raw powder
Turn my man into a star in 24 hours
He didn't care spent the money in like 4 hours
on a Benz with like 400 and Horsepower
And a chain that had christ on it, a rollie with a lot of Ice on it
A pinky ring with a price on it, when he come around
Its likely that he blunted
With a pretty lady in them Nikes that you wanted
It's well know he kept it on his hip like a cell phone
If you speak with him you can pick up on his jail tone
He used to say he wasn't going back without blowing back
and now I'm black I wouldn't put it past him
The D's would Harass him, til he finally blacked out
They told my nigga to freeze, but he still backed out
Shots fired 'til his trigger finger got tired
All the newspapers said was 'Another Nigga Dead'
And it's fucked up
[Chorus]
'cause now I ain't wit cha, know that I miss ya, some how I carry on
I can still picture, when I was wit cha like you was never gone
I remember the good times, all of the bad times
I dedicate this song, to my niggaz laid out, Til my niggaz lay down
Can Ya Hear Me, I know you hear me
[Fabolous]
You can catch me in a cherry red 8-50 nice ass
great titties, face pretty everybody know that she date smitty
A big time dealer that's doing a state biddin
who did more than his share of dirt in the world
enough to make a nigga think about hurtin' his girl
so he used to tell his queen to stay to the castle
away from the hassle to the day that he pass through
There's some enemies he might have who may want to blast you
She stayed for a few years, that's until a few pairs
convinced her to come and hang out around New Year's
It's been awhile, you can see it in her smile
and she ran into her man's Co-Defendant in the trial
who started going on about how he moving on
about running with them same niggaz Smitty had warned about
She slid off told her girl, she had to drop her kid off
They found her in the parking lot, somebody blew her lid off
and it's fucked up
[Chorus - 2X]
'cause now I ain't wit cha, know that I miss ya, some how I carry on
I can still picture, when I was wit cha like you was never gone
I remember the good times, all of the bad times
I dedicate this song, to my niggaz laid out, Til my niggaz lay down
Can Ya Hear Me, I know you hear me
'cause now I ain't wit cha, know that I miss ya, some how I carry on
I can still picture, when I was wit cha like you was never gone
I remember the good times, all of the bad times
I dedicate this song, to my niggaz laid out, Til my niggaz lay down
Can Ya Hear Me, I know you hear me"

You see I do's what I choose on shiny twenty-two's
Be's what I please in brand new Bentleys
That's right stupid! Soon as they couped it, I went and scooped it
Now I'm on the move, on the move
Running the City, something like Diddy
At 150, wit the gun and the cd (wow!)
Niggaz who be hunting for biddies
Never seen nothing this pretty, and they lying if they say they do
They bring the playa through like they bring the mayor through
They know the way I do is what the AK'll do
Listen here we can disappear for a day or two
Bet you come back smiling like Mase, see'mon!
Like Case say 'Touch Me, Tease Me'
But the Top Dawg tell her it must be easy
I'm in the white cut E-Veezy
Ashton Cuts be freezy, it must be easy!

See I ain't keep going tit for tat your ass ma
If your ass ain't talking right
Well you can stop acting boughie, asking for sushi
If fucking ain't your plans tonight, ya hear me?!

If fucking ain't your plans tonight, ya hear me?!

Girl move it like! Girl move it like.

You see I bop to the beat of the streets since I was born
Move like they would in the hood until I'm gone
The girls know my paper denim, keep paper in em
As soon as they change the shapes I'm in em
The BAPEs they send em wit snake skin in em
To the kid in the city wit the scrapers in em
(Nowww!) I move to left like.. then I move to the right like
They follow the need to follow my lead
Do the do then swallow my seed, like
You can leave the spot you cramped in
Live in the Hamptons like a champion
Refuse to choose the, use the loser
Don't let the hydro moves confuse ya
And pass on a stunner to go wit a fronter
If you want to do the kick it then go wit a punter

You see the white's so bright it's hard to be polite
The yellow's so mellow I have to act ghetto
Hello, my name is - fuck that! I'm famous

I don't know what it be, baby girl could it be
You ain't see how good it be rolling wit me?
Like - get me on or get me gone
It's at least 22's that they sit me on

Fixing you hairdo in a Jacob wit baguettes girl

This is way before a nigga brought grey plaques in
So if i spray mac-10s, Bet you niggas lay back then

Yea I made crack grins but ain't a damn thing funny
I keep a pocket fulla do the damn thang money
I keep it comin with bottles of champagne dunny
So keep it bouncin till you pull a hamstring honey
These pimps just better have a gothic for me
I got them hoes starin like they got a problem with me

I teach you to rap in my Sunday School
These bitches get a one day rule
You gotta fuck be Monday, cool?
Or she gotta stroke a stick like the hun play pool
If not you gotta walk like a runway fool
Catch me in the moon shine or the sun ray jewels
If you keep sayin your prayers maybe one day you'll..
..be blessed like me 'til then keep stompin in your Air Force O-N-E-S Nikes

All I gotta do is drive the Range through and nod
It's like I was put here to put layers in the air
Put squares in my ear, put squares in the chair
Put pairs in the rear
I even put 20 inch footwear in my spare
Lord knows I gotta stay on them spinners
Dis verse is like grace that you say on your dinners
Girls come wit me knowin that they gonna be sinners
But, I'ma sense of relief
And I ain't never been a trick kinda like its against my belief
If she got it from me then I'm convinced she a theif
But they say God giveth and He taketh away
And I can do the same thing when I shake with the 'K
If a nigga make a mistake wit the pay, Goddamit
At the club I get right in
So if heaven got a ghetto I should fit right in
God loves me

Now just what kind of ho are you?
Are you a tough ho, or a soft ho? (That's right)
Are you a big ho, or a little ho? (Lil' teenie weenie)
A domestic ho, or an international ho?
A rich ho, or a broke ass ho?

Yea, me momma got my name from the Baptist who made
tha wrong moves wit the women and died for it
You make the wrong moves when you come and you try for it

I'm spittin the gospel
I hit my apostle's wit the coke that'll heal a sick
soon as it get in they nostrils
A Dros Trios, bring the organs on ya
A 40-Caliber'll turn ya to a organ donor
And a day or two, you'll be a morgue aroma
While I go city to city fillin the pieu's up
I ask God to forgive me while I'm fillin the Uz' up
Demons won't let me see a man fillin my shoes up
I ease 'em wit a sermon, but that ain't hard
When I'm in the Beamer before they released 'em to the Germans
You prolly got the man you love wit you
But wouldn't you rather have the Man above wit you?
Can I get an Amen
[Reverend talking]
Now some of ya'll are pimps, And some of ya'll are hoes
But the rest.. the rest of ya'll.. don't think I don't know
Ya just a hater.. They hate what you got
They put a black eye on on the game whenever they play
They piss in the pool, And they fart on the elevator
Then look you in the face, Like they think you did it
They hate change (They hate change)
And they hate progress
They hate me and they hate you
They hate they own momma
'cause they think its her fault that they ain't got shit
But I'm here to tell ya today
That if you a hater
Then you are the outter take or your own business (Amen)
And someody just put 25 dollars in the collection plate
So I'ma go up on the corner
And buy me a fish sandwich
Y'all hold it down, I'll be right back

In the presence of the man
Your future looks better than ya past if you present with the man
You better breathe!
You niggas can't share my air
Or walk a mile in the pair I wear
And I'm getting better year by year
Like they say Juan do
Cops couldn't smell me if you brought the canines through
And I pace myself
I know these money hungry bitches want to taste my wealth
But I keep em' on a diet
Embrace they health
Or either keep em' on a quiet
And space myself
And just take a deep breath
I got em' grabbin' they chest
'Cause it's hurtin' em' to see Fab in his best
And they in they worst
They rather see me lay in the hearse than lay in the back
And I ain't just laying a verse
I'm saying the facts
I came back with some sicker stones
That got these broke niggas looking at me like they chokin' on a chicken bone
Every chick I bone
Can't leave the dick alone

'cause the cops want to lock and harass us
And make it hard to breathe!
They has to react
Like havin' a asthma attack
When they see the plasma in back
You dudes are wheezin' behind me
My flow is like a coupe, breezing at ninety
That's the reason they signed me
It's quick metaphors and hard punches on the cuts
Feels somethin' like hard punches to the gut
How I address the haters and under estimaters
And ride up on them like they escalators
They shook up and hooked up to respirators

Look at them gangstas
[Verse 1]
Fab's livin' la vida loca
Only nigga in the hood you can come see for either weed or coca
Nark's wanna see me and my team in a chair
They heard about the kid with the high beams in his ear
DEA been lookin' for proof since 9-3
When I came thruogh in the Benz with the roof behind me
Tell them jake's through on bullet proof's and find me
You need extingwishers to go in the booth behind me
Who the fuck wanna beef
My Fendi knits be [3X] so you can't see whats tucked underneath
And I might not even drop
Just take my advance and make a small town in Cleveland pop
""Vivrant Thing"" on my hip, that will make you ""Breathe and Stop""
Rock ya chain in ya shirt, Your roll (Rollie) with the sleeve on top
You niggas know where my heat stay at
I leave niggas MIA and I ain't talkin where the Heat play at
C'mon

Niggas don't think I'm still shavin crack
Cause I pull up in a truck with a system that make the pavement crack
Baugettes have my face and beard covered
And I keep a Leathal Weapon like Mel Gibson and Dan Glover
Now I lose V Money and C Lo
And the cops think me and Muggs is G Money and Nino
I don't hit these honey's with C-Notes
Rather put them on Greyhound, Strap these honey's with kilo's
Type of gangsta every chick wants
I get Nike's from Aster you won't see hit the store for 6 months
Something bout the Beamer [X5]
When I come through it be increasing a skeo's sex drive
Half the click look like they stuck Genisis up
The other half is tryin to wrap they sentances up
Im never gone hate, Half these artists never slum weight
When they call NY, its the only time they touch the 7-1-8

I lay low on the other side of the globe
Carat's hangin out the side of my lobe
Pull in ya drivers side and unload
They find ya when its time for your ride to be towed
On side of the road
With ya brain on ya passenger side of ya Rove (Rover)
y'all niggas ain't gangstas til' y'all ridin
And Fed's tell ya hit a chick once and she runnin back like Fred Taylor
Im snatchin everything in the PJ's now
Thats why most these niggas is workin' with the DA's now
If I'm in a hoop ride or a buggy coupe 5
Keepin' it Gangsta
If I'm with a hoochie freak or a dime in Gucci sneaks
Keepin' it Gangsta
If I'm probally in the hood or I'm in Hollywood

True indeed
(Ha ha, You know how we doin' baby?)
Keepin' it Gangsta, uh, yeah, uh, yeah, uh, yo
How many men could you kill? (Let me count all the bullets I got)
Many bricks could move, (you can say 20 a block)
Many niggas'll ride (you could fill a football field)
(How much money you got?) You think I signed a football deal
(My nigga give me the word, I'm gonna kill that lane)
You know major league niggas play the kidnap game
Have the kid missin' for days, listen and pray
(And I'm kill 6 of your niggas, 6 different ways
And we still got exza of rhymes) Still gangsta
(Try to run up on the guy, that send your legs to your mom)
And we still got kilos of coke
(Ruff Ryders to the death, ride or die nigga we know the oath)
That's why I'm tryin' to send this metal through your head
Cause you got me curious, you probably look better when your dead
Nine by the spine, (5th in the holst)
Scum bag it's them D-Block boys, daddy kissin' the ghost
(Comin' through like the ""Matrix"" in the A-6
Triple black leather, six-speed, with the gray stick)
Give me the safe, I spit at your face
Double clip in your mug, then have SP hit it wit mase
(And we just caught burners and do me I'll say this)
Your little niggas lookin' up to me like the walls in Green Haven
Keep heat and we shank ya, (rob ya and say thank ya)

Yeah, OK, uh, yeah, uh, yo
We your favorite gangstas, favorite gangstas (do better both)
Before these slugs sink hitters, weighs like anchors
We don't own clean guns (all our skets is dirty
I toss bullets, New York niggas gel like Testaverde
I don't keep the scope on the ratchet
And for the dope I'm gonna catch it)
Make sure the joint ain't point blank so they can't open your casket
My whole crew (got glocks on 'em)
In a hurry to shoot, (like they put shot clocks on 'em)
All that gossip we blast, better see if they possibly has
A V12 ambulance that will get you to a hospital fast
(We done came out the cages in shackles
I ain't call a pager to track you
I'm loadin' up gauges to whack you
We been riding together
And us back and forth), it's like puttin' Saddam Hussein and Bin Laden together
Soon as you get a crumb, they want to bury ya
That's why I travel with a semi, like Eddie in ""Coming to America""
(Silencers, it sound like it's hummin' when I'm airin' ya
Won't know you hit, 'til your body start numbin' in that area)
The kids don't want to see the toast of mom and daddy
Plus we rather be roastin' Charming fatties
In a toasted armor Caddy
(And we come through, with chains glisten and thangs spittin'
Hollow shots'll leave your brain missin'
Ghetto F A be	(and Paul Cain nigga)
We gettin' heaps of complaints for Keepin' it Gangsta (Keepin' it Gangsta)

M.O.P. (OK), rip rounds at you clown ass niggas (All day)
B Day nigga get up off snooze [snoring noise]
Don't make me put your gangsta on the 6 o'clock news
You ride in a what (what's up), don't get it fucked up
Or twisted, cause you'll get it twisted and fucked up
And die in that truck
(be cautious when your walkin' through, be careful who you talkin' too, comes the boom)
It's the livest motherfuckers of the century
You niggas is killin' me, you got to be kiddin' me (ah ha ha)
Ain't nobody takin' it and makin' it
Extra like dust, throwin' they ass on the record and bless it like Gus

As far as meat goes, we keep those, the street knows
The Mo (Mo) P is what's up

But I ain't Usher Raymond,
I'm the kid that they rush to blamin', for the crush they claimin',
Who can make em' blush the same when I ask,
""What's my name"" and they yell,
F-A-be	-Ohh
You shouldn't have even brought her my direction,
Unless she was handcuffed with an order of protection, Yeah.
I'm talkin wreckless now,
'Cause I'm the reason that your girlfriends are your ex's now..nigga

I'm the fella that keep em yellin, and its nuttin to get em,
I don't sweat em', its what I tell em',
And they quickly forget em',
And I bet em' I get them to forget the day that they met em'
And I let em', cause I can spend em'
And its more then the denim,
But I've been
Born to move, while you dudes be sleeping,
The coupe on 22's keep the Shorey sneaking,
And she won't tell the truth, she too used to creepin
The mic is in the booth, it's the truth I'm speaking
[Fabolous]
Any girl I gave it to..
can't even go love another man,
I give it to em' like no other brother can,
She say my man can barely move me,
Before you made me scream, like a scary movie,
On top of that,
I'm smoother then the rest of the gangsters,
And I knew that dude you met, was a wanksta
Oh.
Damn homie,
Your girl is with the street Fab. Homie,
And she ain't fuckin with you
[Mike Shorey]
It's a shame, you lames
Can't even maintain your thangs,
And its insane the way, that she gave me brain
I pimp things the same, don't forget the name
And when chicks peep the chain, they just can't restrain
Shorty don't try to fake it,
Just up and face it,
Your time is being wasted, your mans a basic
See it all in his face, that he's cheap and tasteless,
But life is what you make it, just watch the bracelet
[Fabolous]
I bet your man can't do it like me,
His veins don't pump pimp fluid like me,
He's nowhere near or like me,
And he probably think keeping you in check,
Is buying you a pair of Nike's
Why wouldn't I.. get dough from her,
When the digits on my checks, look like phone numbers
Fuck It,
You might as well tell that buster skid addle,
Not even Catherine can help him in his custody battle
Yeah.
[Mike Shorey]
You can catch me in the club, with a case of bub
And a thick chick to rub, niggas hate because
When they sit in the truck, they be quick to fuck
When I'm getting a nut, they just lick it up
I'm in favor if, bust a flow is dangerous,
I don't aim to give shortys our relationships,
But they crave the chips, how many the range can fit
She just changed a bit, since I got the hang of it

And put a hole in your chest that's big enough to drive a truck through
I bring the drama back where you lives, flatter your wiz
Reload and then point the Mag at your kids
So what I sound remorse, the records I still peep guns on me
But the difference now is only Deserts
If I talk it's gonna be reckless, I'm ready to die
So when I apply pressure, niggaz gon' respect it
Tote guns to rob niggaz, I told 'em to use
And leave enemies of friends that like broken and bruised
They ain't crazy, they just broke and confused, cross me
And they'll be talks of how they found the man smoked on the news
I'ma career crook they used a mug shot from my graduation picture
And my junior high school yearbook
Paul Cain never appear shook
Yeah, I might talk to my enemies but never police

Show me the money and the cheddar'll speak

For the back stabbers, to be standin' behind me, wit they knives out
Then the Range, wit the fins drove in
I wasn't shocked to see my foes, dressed in friends clothin'
But I still pull through the sty, wit handguns
As big as the one, Robocop pulled from his thigh
You prolly heard about the bullets I buy and how it look like
I'm throwin' batteries, when the bullets shoot by
So what, you wear a vest, why would I care
If I aim for ya chest, that be a good idea
Nigga, it's nothing to clap ya but I'm more worried
Bout the groupie cops, who wanna put they cuffs on a rappa
That's why I'm limpin' off wit a freak and a lawyer
Who woulda got O.J. Simpson off in a week
I could show you how to blow up on ya own in a Benz
That'll hit a buck and make the windows go up on they own
Wit a stash box compartment for a handgun
That make holes the size of peep holes, on apartment doors
My closet look like department stores and you wonder why
Ya girl's comin' home, wit a cigar sip for
'Cause I just dump the light Dutch, mash the guts
You won't believe how much ass I touch
Who else struts pass the sluts, and a chain wit so much
Ash and cuts, that it hangs much pass the nuts
That's why I get followed by broads wit deeper throats
Then the people at the circus, that be swallowin' swords
Y'all hopin' that the Don fall off but my money's long enough
To keep shootin' ya bank until, ya arms fall off
I'm eatin', and I ain't have to use someone's utinsels
And when you clean as me, you know that every bum is against you
But please don't let someone convince you to test the kid
And get hit wit slugs as long, as a No. 2 Pencil, fucka

Some niggas'll rob and some niggas'll pitch
Some niggas ain't got shit, some niggas rich
Some niggas do the time and some live as a snitch
Now some niggas like to pull out and talk, some niggas pop off
Some niggas found they way to the top, some niggas got lost
Some niggas keep it thorough in jail, some niggas got soft
Some niggas ride hard top Coupe, I pull the top off

Quick to back, any nigga gettin' money, come up off of the safe

I'm like O, from the 'Wire', walk wit a sawed-off and a .8
When I was taught, never talk wit a snake
When you kill a nigga you love, you pay for the coffin' and weight
Get you wrapped up and tossed in a lake
If you can't get the whole pie, just take ya portion and skate
Don't fuck wit niggas, if they soft or they fake
Only jail cats and niggas going back and forth
To court could relate, fuck wit me and I'ma alter ya fate
Send some wolves after ya girl

These niggas act like, I ain't sling the clip at the last lane
And ran to the cops to bring the tips of the last names

Like I ain't bring the shipments and past caine
And sticky that'll leave ya finger tips wit the grass stains

Like I don't swing and zip through the fast lane
Would you believe, this ringer chipped me a fast range?
(Nigga)
Like I ain't sling on stips, till my past fame
And stacked it up, like the Pringle chips, when the cash came

Like I ain't fling and dip, when the task came
I knew these niggas sing like pits, so I stash change
The singles chipped in my ass changed
But this player never pay for, them rings and whips, just to gas dance
I'm why you stay in touch wit ya writer
Even made you pick up ya pen and start clutchin' it tighter
I ain't much of a fighter but I know, everything
About rollin' up, like a Dutch in a Spyder
My dope is much more than whiter
One hit'll have the fiends yellin' out

But now could you hear nigga all in this place
That when you see him in the streets, you gettin' all in his face
More you give a nigga, the more that he takes and you wanna beef
Knowin' I'm slower than do so, 'cause I got much more at stake
Huh, that's why I'm ignorin' ya page
I can't respect you no more, you's a fraud and a snake
But you noticed that's the hate that I love
You see me eating off rat, that same feat you think you capable of
Don't get me worng, I would like to get it
But you acting like, I ain't blow my show money on a rifle fetish
And my pop's voluntarily, surrendered to the Fed's
This is the wrong time to fuck wit my head
I'm tryna tell you, friends are ya worst enemies
So if I make friends wit my worst enemies
That'll maybe even things out
But one in ya dome is easy, get it on if need be
Chrome for sheezy, please, don't believe me
Some niggas thug and some niggas is bitch
Some niggas'll rob and some niggas'll pitch
Some niggas ain't got nothin', some niggas rich
Some niggas do the time and some live as a snitch, nigga"
renegade,2003,fabolous,Hip-Hop,"Uh, you think I give a fuck about
What these niggas say man
They even talked about Jesus
I ain't mad at when it rain, 'cause I know the sun is somewhere shinin'
Sorta like some clear diamonds
I hardly see my moms, but she know her son is somewhere grindin'
Some where rhymin', or somewhere climbin'
Out of a pottable 760, inclasable very sticky
Wit a handgun, to send these cowards to Heaven quickly
I ain't pussy, so I won't allow you to ever dick me
I know these grease balls, wonder how could they ever stick me
But I move, like the President through town
Wit stones the size of earrings, in my Presidential crown
I put hollows from the Desert into clowns, 'cause the cometary
Is where most of the dudes, that are hesitant are found
So I take the time, of whatever the bench throws
The 4BM put down, in a seventy-two inch hole
Mean while getting adapted, to the fame has be hectic
But I'm fucking like I'm tryna take down Chamberlain's record
And the girls more than like you, when you running around
Doing world tours like Michael, but girl's sure don't like you
You going on like thirty-six, flowin' on some berry mix
The little money you get, you blowing on them dirty chicks
Tryna look young, so you throwing on the jersey quick
I'm on my second V-12, you going on ya thirty-six
You can look at this rider, and see I'm on the come-up
'Cause I pass the hitch-hikers, like I don't see 'em with they thumb up
I just turn the system up and keep boppin'
I never get, where I'm tryna go, if a nigga keep stoppin'
And I tell the cops, this joint is for protection
Don't they see when I come through
How these people point in my direction
That's why I poke out my jeans
Like my joint with a erection
Till I'm in a joint made for correction
And right now, the way rapper bi'ness spread
It wouldn't even surprise me
If one of these rappers is a Fed, nigga
Since I'm in the position to get rich, I'ma get it
Whether it come from rapping on blocks, flippin' and pitchin'
And fuck the stove, and the kitchen where I cook and prepare it
Nigga you know and don't try to act like the truth ain't apparent
I'm on a mission to get richer, it's as simple as that
I make it obvious, when I pick up a pencil and rap
Like a .40 Cal, spittin' on instrumentals I clap
And these verses, are like the hollow point I sent through yo back
I get you murdered if I think you a rat
'Cause if you don't show loyalty
Then that show me where ya principles at
And you don't know how much I been through, in fact
I never did like you, I ain't even gon' pretend wit you cats
And I'm the nicest, I ain't gotta say it twice and repeat it
I'm a lyrical genius, I never been beated, defeated
I'ma draw my weapon and squeeze it, you better believe it
Leave you parapaligic, I demand respect and I mean it
My Desert's the meanest, you probably dead if you seen it
Or spored out somewhere sick, you get red on the cement
And I blow off ya head for no reason and just when I'm leavin'
You don't know me ya owe me homie
But the spread make us even, blow
And the bad part about it is man
I'm only twenty years old man
And I'm just havin' fun
Man I ain't even tryin' man
Desert Storm's youngest and in charge man
Paul Cain, man
Yo Fab man, you ain't even gotta go hard man
I got these niggas man

Want to label me a criminal and cuff me up
Got a pocket full of money so they rough me up
I ain't trippin' in the county and I'm mad as fuck
Got a record so they put me with the baddest bunch
Everybody want to talk cause I'm rappin'
They askin' me what happened
Is it true you did a flick with Janet Jackson
I can't sleep they takin' polaroids
And I'm tryna to use the phone but they makin' noise
Man I wish I had my glock cause its major
I'm makin' shanks out the plastics in razors
These motherfuckers won't leave me alone that's my word
'Bout to turn a violation to a motherfuckin' murder

Mobbin' in the park after dark want to start shit
Rippin' up the scene as a teen I was at it (but hey)
And sellin' products to the addicts cause they gotta have it
I was a well-known thug and I gotta lotta love
Hangin out with the OG's shootin' up the clubs
And mama told me don't hang with the homies
But they got me if they need me then it's on G
Got me sittin' in the cell a five by seven
Will I finally get to go to ghetto heaven
Got my bitches on the outside writin' me letters
And they tell me they love me and the shit you'll get better
I don't believe her cause I just got the news on the wire
Take it how you want it but your bitch is on fire
I gotta be a player so I stay strong

I sit alone in my room, drinkin'
Without a care
Talkin' out loud to ya'
Like ya' there
Take ya' picture out my back pocket
Man it's on
You the first face I wanna see
When I get home
I wanna love you 'till the sun rise
Buckwild
Touchin' every wall in the house
Thug style
Put ya' hands on the headboard
Think of me
Drippin' sweat on top of you
Sick of scenes in yo' head
That I'm makin' love
So turn the lights down
Reminisce 'n relax
Cause baby right now
I feel in the middle of my stomach
You whisper in my ear
Baby tell me how you really want it
Hold on tightly
Watch the ceiling
Scratch my back
How you react
Lets me know you feel me
Cause everything I'm giving to you
Is so true
Thugs get lonely too
You know.
I'm rolling out on tour today you getting sad because I'm goin' away (Na)
Chickenheads wanna play with me you getting mad because you think I'ma sway,
Some of them cute some of them fine as fuck I hear them scream as soon as I hit the stage (Na)
Still I be getting lonely for you I'm coming home as soon as I make this pay (Make this pay)
Yeah! Thug life baby!"

Black cotton
Black cotton, a symbol for unrewarded struggle
Time for a little gospel tail
Ghetto gospel that is- listen
Robbin' Black Cotton in God's eyes
Speak
Black Cotton
Steady stressin' Smith and Wessons count my blessin's
Class is in session the worst question is the first question
Why do we work like slaves sweatin' blades to an early grave
Never got paid but still we slave (In the nine tre')
Answer that then answer this too-
Loves gonna get ya you know it's true life's a bitch true
You best to backtrack and try to act black and live
Not to be phony and positive but why be negative?
What's the matter G? Black cat got your tongue
Fat track gotcha sprung now your hung (Do ya feel me?)
Dumb dumb diddy is it me?
Attempt to reach each and every brother on the streets
If not peace then at least let's get a piece
I'm tired of seeing bodies on the streets- deceased
Lookin' through my high school yearbook
Reminiscin' of the tears as the years took
One homie, two homie, three homies, poof!
We used to have troops but now there's no more youth to shoot
God come save the misbegotten
Lost ghetto souls of Black Cotton (In God's eyes)
Nobody don't care
(No matter how hard I try, look to the sky)
Nobody don't care
(Seems like my dreams, drowned in by screams, no answer to my questions)
Nobody don't care
(Feels like I'm pressed, why do I stress? It's like I'm being tested)
Nobody don't care
(Seems like my prayers, vanish to thin air, please answer my questions)
Nobody don't care
In the belly of the beast I'm bubbling up
Running out of luck, about to self destruct
Old heads say live your life like such
Your sure to catch her witcha one day boy
I wouldn't listen to 'em
Your power movement was cool
But it ain't fix nothin'
So I just go with what I know
I don't trust none
Look what the 80's did
To what's Bebe's kids
And now we grown up
Nobody ain't own us yet
Black cotton, I'm plottin',
I'm workin' without a profit
They shacklin' all my homies
I'm hurtin' but keep the mind
?
Certainly we survive with Outlaw Ridas
What's the reward for a strugala
If the lord lovin' us then why they hate to see us comin' up
Runnin' up, Gun cocked like nasty gloves
If you ain't got a penny, mind the glove
No love
Waitin' for my 40 acas and a blunt to blaze
Biblicle times good hearts with militia minds
Black Cotton, I'm hoppin' over enemy lines
Black Cotton, I ain't stoppin' till they givin' me mine
Black Cotton
Nobody don't care
(No matter how hard I try, look to the sky)
Nobody don't care

ghetto-gospel,2004,2pac,Hip-Hop,"Uh, hit em with a little ghetto gospel
Those who wish to follow me
My ghetto gospel
I welcome with my hands
And the red sun sinks at last
Into the hills of gold
And peace to this young warrior
Without the sound of guns
If I could recollect before my hood days
I sit and reminisce
Thinking of bliss and the good days
I stop and stare at the younger
My heart goes to em
They tested with stress that they under
And nowadays things change
Everyone's ashamed of the youth cause the truth look, strange
And for me it's reversed
We left em a world that's cursed
And it hurts
Cause any day they'll push the button
And all come in like Malcolm X or Bobby Hutton died for nothing
Don't it make you get teary
The world looks dreary
When you wipe your eyes see it clearly
There's no need for you to fear me
If you take your time and hear me
Maybe you can learn to cheer me
It ain't about black or white cause we human
I hope we see the light before it's ruined, my ghetto gospel
Those who wish to follow me
My ghetto gospel
I welcome with my hands
And the red sun sinks at last
Into the hills of gold
And peace to this young warrior
Without the sound of guns
Tell me do you see that old lady
Ain't it sad
Living out of bags
Plus she's glad for the little things she has
And over there there's a lady
Crack got her crazy
Guess who's giving birth to a baby
I don't trip or let it fade me
From out of the fryin' pan
We jump into another form of slavery
Even now I get discouraged
Wonder if they take it all back
Will I still keep the courage
I refuse to be a role model
I set goals, take control, drink out my own bottles
I make mistakes but learn from every one
And when it's said and done
I bet this brother be a better one
If I upset you don't stress never forget
That God isn't finished with me yet
I feel his hand on my brain
When I write rhymes I go blind and let the Lord do his thing
But am I less holy
Cause I chose to puff a blunt and drink a beer with my homies
Before we find world peace
We gotta find peace and end the war in the streets
My ghetto gospel
Those who wish to follow me
My ghetto gospel
I welcome with my hands
And the red sun sinks at last
Into the hills of gold
And peace to this young warrior
Without the sound of guns
Lord can you hear me speak
To pay the price of being hellbound"

I'm a little nigga, that's why its so raw to just watch me battle lions,
'Cause I'm a little skinny nigga battlin' niggas three times my size""
Watch this uppercut, here it come
Watch the jab nigga, ugh
Here it come, look out, watch my arms
Now see so many motherfuckers want to take a piece
Commin' equipped with some shit that niggas just can't believe
I pull a trick from my sleeve now kamikaze
I'm all over that nigga, come identify the body
My middle finger to you hoe niggas
Run up on me, and ill be forced to let it go nigga
I ain't the one you want to try, why, stayin' high
I hit this blunt an watch these motherfuckers die
Whose runnin' these streets I said that cocaine
Cause in the the dope game, niggas'll die 'fore they go broke mayne
Another hustler makin' major cash
'til the punk police come an raid ya ass
Now you stressed doin' fed time, and its a bitch
Cause the judge gave you 8 years, you doin' 6
And we know that you can't hang, you a trick
Rolled over turned snitch like a biatch
Now you know you shoulda ducked nigga
Gotchu fallin' from the uppercut, fucked, so what's up nigga
Now you know you shoulda ducked nigga

Molotov cocktails, release an up in flames
Tired of bein' stepped on, sick of bein' held back
Lookin' through my rear view, thinkin' bout the pay back
Want to see my kids grow don't know if imma make it though
One more nigga came up short in the ghetto
Society lied to me so I'm strapped with the metal
Push ya middle finger up nigga if you a rebel
Have ya face down goin in ya pockets if ya let em

I done made so many mistakes but still I don't regret em

Do you have a little time to have a little time for me?
As soon as I leave the house you want to page me
See you got me trapped I'm going crazy this is slavery
You act like it's outrageous give me space it won't get better
And maybe we will argue and be through with all these sorry letters
Soon as I come home it's like I get the third degree
Where ya been and who you with I get no room to breathe It makes me want to leave
I'm sick of these tricks up your sleeve
Your suspicious I deceive give me grief without belief but to me
If you really trust me then it's pitiful
Question me about my whereabouts that's so trivial
Let me live my life and you can live yours
Just be there to help me and support that's what your here for
Not to give me stress and add to pressure
Home is where I go the rest I go to pass the test
I'm sorry if I left you all alone

Tell me what it takes for us to shake so we can be friends
It's time for us to take our separate paths
We had a lot of laughs but the good things come to pass
Let's think of the evil break don't make it scandoulous
Try to be mature til your sure that we can handle this
Your sayin' I'm too busy I ignore you
I guess you didn't hear me when I said that I cared for you
But now it seems the arguments are nightly
I want to hold you tightly but instead you want to fight me
So why let it stress and aggravate me
Instead I'd rather break hope you don't hate me
You tell me that you love me but your lyin'
Fightin' back the urge to start cryin'
I wipe away your tears come and hug me
I love you like you love me

I can't barely hear you yellin' at me
Maybe we should end it neither one of us are happy
You know that I'm emotional you milk me
Comin' over crying just to get me feelin' guilty
You and me were met to be it yet
You always want to sweat and how much closer can we get (don't fret)
Just set me back my things and I'll be outie
This time I'm breakin out you let your mouth overcrowd me
I can't take the beefin' and the griefin'
I get no room to sleep I hope it ceases cause I'm leavin'
Maybe next time you'll be a little more sure
When I can give you more when you unsure
But baby until then I gotta leave ya
It's not that I don't need ya but see ya

Not because we rushed it (hell no)

I guess it's hard for you to see, but now I'm pointin' the finger at police
Instead of motherfuckers blamin' me
I got the right to bear a pistol
And when them punk motherfuckers get to trippin' I got shit too
And maybe then you'll see the truth
But until then I gotta do what I do and stay a crooked nigga too
It's all up to you
But until then I gotta do what I do and stay a crooked nigga too
And maybe then you'll see the truth
But until then I gotta do what I do and stay a crooked nigga too
It's all up to you
But until then I gotta do what I do and stay a crooked nigga too
And maybe then you'll see the truth
Ooh, you can't fuck with the crew, a crooked nigga too
You know you really can't say that you blame niggaz
Fuck bein' tame, set a flame, tryin' to aim triggaz
2pac'll spark a revolution, fuck the constitution
I want my bucks for restitution
This time you got a bigger problem
Time to face the niggaz from South Central
Oakland, Brooklyn and Harlem
And we ain't shootin' at each other, fuck no
That's a motherfuckin' brother so save two, run for cover
And other bitches from the clan
Come feel the wrath of a black man that doesn't smoke crack
And I don't drink St. Ides, fuck that
Genuine draft ganja-ganja and my fuckin' Tec-9
They know their scared to see us sober
Cobra
And niggaz will take the world over, it's all up to you, up to you
Blame the Korean, fuck that, I'll be a crooked nigga too
It's all up to you
But until then I gotta do what I do and stay a crooked nigga too
And maybe then you'll see the truth
But until then I gotta do what I do and stay a crooked nigga too
It's all up to you
But until then I gotta do what I do and stay a crooked nigga too
And maybe then you'll see the truth
Ooh, you can't fuck with the crew, a crooked nigga too
Pardon me [Incomprehensible] God has been kind and
Try me I'll be damned if I die come look at the rage in my eyes G
They got my homies in a jail cell
Now it's the rebel and the devil and one of us is goin' to hell
I got the whole place covered with lo'ced out brothers
And nothin' but love for each other
So motherfucker make a motion
I give a fuck, slice you up, and throw your ass in the ocean
Temperatures drop, see it's cool to shoot a nigga
But they hate it when we pop the cops
That's when they gettin' petrol
You better watch your step or you'll be left on deathrow
But I learned to look ahead of me
Stay strapped, watch your back, keep your eyes on the enemy
We blowin' up precincts and you can't fuck with the crew
A crooked nigga too
It's all up to you
But until then I gotta do what I do and stay a crooked
And maybe then you'll see the truth
But until then I gotta do what I do and stay a crooked nigga too

loyal-to-the-game,2004,2pac,Hip-Hop,"Now I've got to ask, on a nigga's ass, tell me will they blast me?
I think of an alias in case these crooked bitches ask me
Now, it's gettin' crazy after dark, these narcs
Be like tryin' to shut me down but I'm too smart
Now picture me scared of the penitentiary
I've been movin' these things since the days of elementary
Now tell me what you need when you see me
I'm stackin G's, buyin' all the things on TV, believe me
I got some killas on my payroll, and they know
When it's time to handle business, nigga lay low
Although I'm young, I'm still comin' up
I'm gettin' paid, pullin' raises on niggas when they runnin' up
The first to pull a strap when there's drama
Busta', you ain't heard?
I've been slicin' motherfuckers since I lost my momma
There ain't a cop that can stop me
My posse is cocked, G, and they don't quit until they drop me
I'm loyal to the game
Without no doubt I ain't no slouch and it ain't time to back down
So I jumps in and try to stop-a and watch-a
Slap you cock-eyed like Popeye fucks spinach
Forgotten more shit than most crews ever know, or ever knew
Was born with 7 flows and only heaven knew
For beat the boot sex, the news breaks, the you shakes
Worse, they heard we got more nerve than a 2-fake
Yoo-ho to you crew and you too so you knew
I'm from Jersey and I'm a teen so your block more than you do
Whose the new crew?
Show me your neck brotha', and here's another
Smack your mother's mamma's mother
In the first mob of all those other crack lovers
Back was bitch-ass, trick ass, cluk-clow-cluk-clow
How ya like me then, how ya like me, hey-ho, how ya like me now?
Ow, pow, hurt, don't it? Bow, bow, don't run up on it
The same thing minus ""P"" hangin' possies like an exponent
Oh yes, rock in slums, ya gots to run it
It makes no sense to smell like shit
If old ass George could be Washing-tons
Now I be loyal to my niggas on the blocks, just buckin' the shots
And packin' the Glocks
And dodgin' the cops, and takin' over niggas spots
Poppin' after poppin the fools be droppin', the hoes be hoppin'
On my thing 'cause it hangs like the nets from Above the Rim
You lookin' grim, is it me or him or him
Or be with me, we be together
So what's up? We can do whatever
'Cause real niggas stick together
Till they make it up to heaven
Through the stress, through the hell, through the 1-8-7
The shorter the nigga, the bigga the trigga
The deeper they dig the ditch-a
The Naughty the Treach
Then through to the Pac I brings the Glock I wets up
You fuckin' body, I'm like, oh my Gody
Did I really shoot him? Yo I shot him
So got him, now I puts the crime behind me
And finds me, a place to lays my head low
I lives doin' my rap, but I dies for my hood row
So all you fuckin' fools better recognize, and know my fuckin' name
I be Riddler to my niggas and I'm loyal to the game"

Bienvenidos a mi nido
No me tienen que pagar na', yo los invito
Esto va por la casa, no me tienen que dejar propina
La receta de hoy es la especialidad de la cocina
Carne asesina, y pa' que aguanten el pico
Un poco de yuca frita con mojito
(""Do you have some Doritos?"") No, yuca frita con mojito
(""Do you have some Coca-Cola?"") No, pero tengo vino Perico
Y rapidito ese tipo me salio malcriadito
(""Do you know who I am?"") Â¿Como? Â¿Que te llamas Juan?
(""Do you know who I am?"") Â¿Que si yo me llamo Juan?
(""Yo querer Coca-Cola!"") Pues, mira Juan
AquÃ­ lo que hay es Cola Champagne y chinita
Pero si quieres una notita Medalla es la cervecita
(""I just want Coca-Cola!"") Â¡Te dije que no me llamo Juan!
Â¡Y que lo que hay es Cola Champagne!
Y al rato ese prieto me dijo que se llamaba Puff Daddy
Y que el era el Sugar Daddy de todos los Mack Daddies
Me salio de atrÃ¡s pa'lante, bien bocÃ³n como altoparlante
AsÃ­ que lo escupÃ­ con salsa picante y al instante se puso de pies
Y en una senta' le dije que tenia la lengua malcria'
(""Do you know who I am?"") Â¡Te dije que no me llamo Juan!
Y ahÃ­ fue que lo cruce por la quija', entonces se fue a la pica'
A las millas de chaflÃ¡n con un chichÃ³n en la chola a lo Mamadou Thiam
Y yo lo perseguÃ­ por to'a la San SebastiÃ¡n
Hasta la Calle del Cristo y ahÃ­ fue cuando me tire el Sixto
El Sixto Escobar, con el uno-dos y el jab
Lo puse a volar como chiringa
Lo puse a escupir agua de piringa por los pantalones
EmpezÃ³ a botar azÃºcar negra por los calzones
Y hasta por las medias botando mojones
Mojones color verde oliva, si, color verde oliva
Lo que caga la gente fina por comer platos de comida

Si no donqueamos, nos vamo'a de gÃ¼irita
Y to' los gringos como tu se pueden ir con to' y camarita por la Garita
No tienen que hacer cita si ustedes son visita
""Say cheese!"", y una sonrisita y pa' la playita
Pa' los tiburones pa' que te arranquen los tendones
Porque aquÃ­ en Puerto Rico somos los mas jodones
Y despuÃ©s de eso Puff Daddy regreso a los New Yores
Un poco sato, menos hombre, con otro sobrenombre
P. Diddy, Mister P. Diddy, aquÃ­ esta tu bibi
Pa' que chupes un poco de leche borriqueÃ±a
Pa' que lo pienses dos veces antes de coger una leÃ±a
Pa' que cuando vengas pa' acÃ¡ no hagas muecas, no hagas seÃ±as
Esto te puede costar to'a las greÃ±as
AsÃ­ que si no quieres que te sacudan el tabique
PiÃ©nsalo antes de meterte con un cacique
Esto no es Mozambique, esto es Puerto Rico
AquÃ­ te das contra el seto
AquÃ­ todo el mundo usa peto
AquÃ­ en Puerto Rico casi to' el mundo es molleto
AquÃ­ aunque seas blanco eres prieto
AquÃ­ hay respeto o te lo espeto
AquÃ­ se respeta o se te espeta
AquÃ­ se respeta o se te espeta
No me agites, no me hagas decir puÃ±eta

Buenos dÃ­as, Puerto Rico
Son como las 12-y-pico
AsÃ­ que ya es hora de levantarse
Y darse un pase, tu sabes, un pasecito
De zorrullito mezcla'o con sofrito
Y si me traen el bacalaito frito
Yo me lo como, pa' caer entono
Lo bajo con CafÃ© Yaucono
Y despuÃ©s me vo'a fumar un poco de abono
Pa' salir dispara'o por la capa de ozono
Se que al igual que el Papa
Yo no me muevo ni pa' recoger una lata
Que soy un vago y que no tengo trabajo
Que no doy un tajo, que cuando empiezo siempre me rajo
Que almuerzo arroz con ketchup cuando no tengo chavos
Pero esto de estar pela'o no es culpa mÃ­a
Esto es culpa de la alcancÃ­a que esta vacÃ­a
Y esta vacÃ­a porque lo de adentro se lo robaron

Y yo vi quienes fueron, fueron unos enanos
Ya me encabronaron, son tan chiquitos que me encabronan
Me incomodan, ojala y los coga Conan
Y los parta por la mitad con su sÃºper-espada
Que les quite la piel pa' hacer tambores
Y tocar batucada, to'a la noche batucada
Y despuÃ©s esa piel rellenarla con miel melaba
Es mas, no, con ensalada
Con pepinillo, lechuga, tomate
Un chinchÃ­n de aceite
Un chinchÃ­n de aguacate
Y comÃ©rmelo, y tragÃ¡rmelo
Como caramelo, me los como de uno en uno
Trillizos, o gemelos, no me importa
Lo que importa es que los desaparezca
Antes de que amanezca, y me los baje con leche fresca
Directamente desde la teta de la vaca
Pa' despuÃ©s ir al baÃ±o y botarlos por la culata
Y que se pierdan por la tuberÃ­a, mezcla'o con la caca
Nadando con las ratas, mientras yo bajo la tapa del inodoro
Ellos se intoxican con agua con Clorox

No me interrumpas, este es mi viaje

MÃ¡s personal que el hongo vaginal
MÃ¡s personal que un hilo dental cubriendo la zona anal
MÃ¡s personal que meterse sal por el conducto nasal

Engrasa'o de mantequilla, pa' que mueran de cosquillas

Pa' no dejar rastros, pa' no dejar huellas
En la arena, mientras se roba mi berenjena

Pompeada con faena de la buena

A crear fucking pleito
A tratar de sobornar el areyto

Pa' que yo tuviera comida en el termos
Y tu vienes a hablarme a mi y que del combo
Y de que andas con gorilas del Congo
Mira, pai, la Ãºnica gorila es mi abuela
Ella es mi combo, La Perla, flor amelia
Si capoteas con lo mÃ­o
Y no lo quieres aceptar
Vamo' animal, vamo' animal
Si te compraste una prenda
Y la tuviste que empeÃ±ar
Vamo' animal, vamo' animal

Traigo el songoro consongo
Tres tazas de mondongo con mofongo
Tu heba esta enchula con como compongo
AsÃ­ que pendiente a mÃ­ y al Residente
Y de blanco lo Ãºnico que tengo son los dientes
No guardo rencor, eso es cosa de necio
A to' mis enemigos les tengo un largo aprecio
El numero primero junto con el tercero
Trece, residente, Calle 13 con Cevero
La hierba mala la sacamos de tallo
TÃº con pistolas y yo con 20 gallos
De pelea con las pesuÃ±as raras
Entrena'o pa' picotearle la cara
Gallos de pelea entrena'o en Las Cucharas
Y a los puerquitos los asamos en la vara

[Angie]
Welcome to ""Animal House""
The animals are in the building
It's a new day
[Verse: Angie]
Angela... Better known as Angie
We are animals... Animal House... wut we are... animals
Uh yeah uh yeah uh uh uh yeah uh uh
All I could do is give you me if you choose to believe it's on you
I live in peace I could sleep but I don't choose I'ma animal the promos
The station, the movies rap Rebecca Lobo
I run elbows with people you couldn't a ""Hello"" from
With a mask and a gun you don't gotta ask how come or where I'm at
I work! I want to make that clear to cats
Nuttin's free and no you can't run to me
I'm ten years deep you to young for me
You could sleep while I drop album number three and
Yeah you could hate but somebody lovin' me
Evidently number one at 3 with videos on MTV
You could learn from me then it's back to the streets can't be serious
Haha that isn't funny album still sold can't be curious
[Chorus]
Animals that's how it is that's how we are
Walk with our heads up high 'cause we
Animals-straight beasts 18 hours a day work no sleep
We are animals that's how it is that's what we are we are animals
Walk with our heads up high 'cause we animals- straight beasts
18 hours a day work no sleep
[Verse: Sacario]
You ain't know em like the highway patrol
I stay on a roll like Joe Smooth on your back I got creative control
A vocal coach shows singas how to flow
When our engineers songs we verb highs and lows if the shit ain't clear
This year I hope you chose to retire or expire 'cause what I propose is a resonation
'cause the animals is aqua now and all your deticated fans is rolling with me now
I gotta lock to the 5 0 1 n 3 now you gotta watch you can rhyme doin them freestyles
I rather not just do it I make records and write sixteen bars in 500 seconds
It's Sacario AKA Mr. Guntalo BDS news track
My spins is a problem so BMI throw me parties
My publicin is lots a dough we animals get me and ""ang"" espacio
[Chorus]
[Verse: Angie]
Look I'ma professional (I'ma professional)
I'm not stressing you I do what's best for me
You do what's best for you (best for you)
I'm not concerned with the bullshit
Never was (never was) I'm wouldn't check that respect that
I meant 'cause bloods, kings, nietas, and zulus (zulus)
All over this world most who do you
I put in work interviews, shows, promos, rehearsals, reverse moves
All of that shows back to interviews
No time for self, none nigga drive-through diner
No time for my health I'm dyin' hehe
I wonder how I'm surviving myself
Angie OG baby got the title in belt
Queen (quueeeeeeeeeeeeeeen) of hip-hop radio
through the many years blood sweatin tears
Be clear happy to be here on the sequel I'm still workin
I know you got hate in your blood it's still hurtin
[Chorus] - repeat 2X"
never,2002,angie-martinez,Hip-Hop,"[Intro: Girl]
And you will never break me til the day I die
[Verse: Angie]
Yo everytime I turn around they say
How I deal with that weak shit
I told y'all of the stages I can't agree wit
We showed y'all, promoted y'all on how to freak shit
But here's a little secret...
Uh uh we still number one, blazin Hip-Hop and R&B; quick
'cause it's simple and plain, now can you sit and complain quick
When we payed the way for you to get in the game chicks
Nigga's wuteva...it's only the real that they recognize by the real
And since you don't recognize you know the deal
How I feel? I don't know emotions get showed
If anything I feel violated being that we been cloned
Reporterz quit, I don't get caught up in the mix
10 years deep, I was brought up in this shit
OG , big truck series, the cars is gone
Any questions? I'll be directing your comments
To alkatron...sing that shit
[Chorus]
A primitive mind is all I, all I ever had
And you will neva break me til the day I die
[Verse: Angie]
My reputation and my name is superb
Now add that with animal house and a flow that's like rain down a curb
'cause I, write a verse and I change a few words, edit and perfected it ..
And and... I'm still on the air about the dough
Be clear, you gotta go each year we lock and load
Beware I'm outta control animal mode will let you know not to
hand me no goal
Everything I write hot like my hand on a stove
The (?) know bullshit don't effect me like a ""Die Hard"" knicks fan
So no mas if's and's
I could show you how power shit get ran and I can't get budged
'cause when your best friend is the jury bottom line is you can't get judged
And that last line went over ya head so
You'll probably never know til your dead either way
What I said is real, sing!
[Repeat Chorus]
[Verse: Angie]
Uh yo uh..
And I'm not bein cocky
'cause I work my way up
And even tho' it hurt never gave up
Went from handin' out fliers to number one major.. I don't
I'm about dollars, hold your to cents saved up
Dropped my first album never rock in my life
Did everything on mah own wrote the songs, hit the mic
Get the beats all nice stayed up got it right
Minimal help, felt alone
Now you got a problem right?
'cause it's animal house, the team is here
It's a new day with me this year be clear, I'm focused
Best coaches, way too many peeps
Pro to machines and way to much heat
Still grounded never been way up in the sky
Workaholic still spend days inside
Angie, you could never break me, I move wise
And that's til the day I die, ohh, my, GOD
[Repeat Chorus]"
if-i-could-go,2002,angie-martinez,Hip-Hop,"""If I Could Go""
[Lil' Mo] Yeaaaaaaaaaaayyyyy!!!
[Angie M] Oh yeah yeah
{Lil' Mo] Yeaaaaaaaaaaayyyy!!!
[Angie M] Uh, woo! come on, uh
[Lil' Mo] If I can go, with you
[Angie M] Yo, yo, uh
[Verse 1: Angie Martinez]
If I can chose a place to go it gotta be far away
From here we could crossover like Hardaway
Somewhere outside the states where tomorrow's like today
And I'm out in a space where nobody else can stay
And, if I can go, with you
Then I'll go get the ticket right now if that's cool
Have you ever been close to feelin like leavin the coast too
Feelin like leavin with somebody who
Hold you the right way while watchin the night fade
Make you feel like you right back in the ninth grade
When you know what he likes and what he might say
And you try to be calm and answer in nice ways
And, if I can go, with you
Way out the states no 2 ways and no page
No cells and no trace, and you just a phone call away
So all I got to say is
[Chorus: Lil' Mo]
If I can go, contigo, I'll pack my things, soon as you say
Baby vamos, we'll fly away, like there is no, no tomorrow
If can go, contigo, I'll tell my friends, nothing at all
I'll get my things, soon as you say, baby vamos, we'll fly away
[Verse 2: Sacario]
And, if I can go, with you
Oh boy we 'bout to make a lot of people annoyed
And cry you better know I know how to sneak with them toys
And boy with the block since around 94 boy
And, if I can flow, with you
Huggin Tato after the studio I roll with you
I send Dutch and three other goons to go get you
Sacario the name hold weights the whole issue
Grown men keep on cryin get mo' tissue
The way me and this girl be rhymin it's so official
Them I'm takin a trip too with no pistols
Cause everything peace only sand no streets
Little Miami Heat that's the plan we'll see
Two cups, one in Senado one in Sand Beach
And, I'll think I'll go, with you
So tell the station you need a week back to you
[Chorus: Lil' Mo]
If I can go, contigo, I'll pack my things, soon as you say
Baby vamos, we'll fly away, like there is no, no tomorrow
If can go, contigo, I'll tell my friends, nothing at all
I'll get my things, soon as you say, baby vamos, we'll fly away
[Bridge: Lil' Mo]
You can fly away, no one has to know
Will you take me with you, cause if I can go
Soon as you say the word, we'll be on our way
To a foreign place, you got to tell me
[Angie Martinez]
Yo, uh, so now that we got a plan are you comin? We could plan a week
The only question now is LaGuardia or Kennedy?
[Sacario]
And a seat, know why? the window cause I like to see
And seein as to how I'm so fly me and the clouds can speak
[Angie+S]
And, since we 'bout to go, in a few
[Sacario]
Go 'head
[Angie Martinez]
Oh, I just wanted to tell Trace thank you
That week off I'm grateful what was you tryin to say boo?
[Sacario]
Nuttin just grab my chain off the table and 2 way too
[Angie Martinez]
Ok, that little place it's a great move
But ain't no problems, unless the water don't stay blue
[Sacario]
And the shop's there?
[Angie Martinez]
If they don't got em, they don't make em
([Sacario:] True!)
No concrete just sand, throw away your shoes
Now, that we are on, our way
And our bags is packed and the car service is not late
Everything's ok, so I guess I catch you on the next track
Now I don't gotta ask
[Chorus: Lil' Mo]
If I can go, contigo, I'll pack my things, soon as you say
Baby vamos, we'll fly away, like there is no, no tomorrow
If I can go, contigo, I'll tell my friends, nothing at all
I'll get my things, soon as you say, baby vamos, we'll fly away
[Outro: Lil' Mo]
If I can go, contigo, I'll pack my things, soon as you say
Baby vamos, we'll fly way, like there is no, no tomorrow
And if I can go, contigo, I'll tell my friends, nothing at all
Nothing at all, I'll tell my friends, nothing at all"

All that you've been - waitin' on! [Repeat: x 7]
All that you've been hey heyyy

Now everybody just bounce bounce
When we climb up outta' that truck
And you standin' out in that line
And we walk straight in - nigga that's wassup
Straight to the V-I, where they got them bottles ready
My name good cause we kinda' heavy
Walk in with the hood and the cars steady talkin'
Wish I could, but our time is very important
You should find your mind already
'Cause I got hot shit, hooks kinda' catchy
I spit so quicks no time to catch me, nah-uh don't stress me
'Cause we, just came to make ya bounce
""Tear da club up"" and clear it out
Thugs in the club: beef just air it out
Now everybody just bounce bounce
[Chorus: x 2]
[Verse: Angie Martinez]
Now everybody just bounce bounce
Every time we jump on that stage
From page 1 through to 8
In the hallways or through the day
You know our name good, kinda' thick
Woke up in the spot with the shiny whips
Keep talkin' a lot - bring out the grimey chicks
Incase you forgot how the grimey get
Niggas surround this shit, let me remind you chick
How one hit can leave you all blind and shit
Have to send your little friends to come find your shit
But right now there's really no time to flip
Just bounce, get twisted, get ripped no doubt, that's
what I'm talkin' about
'Till ya whole crew, they walkin' ya out
Swear ya'll never drink again, sure no doubt
[Chorus: x 2]
[Bridge: Petey Pablo]
(That's right) that's right {6x}
That's right (ok,this it it right here)
[Verse: Angie Martinez]
Now if you still bouncin' and this yo shit
Then ok, pump it in your whip
We get it crunk, in the A-T-L
Down in the south, baby blaze that L
Just bounce bounce, rep your hood
Rep your city, playa it's all good
This worldwide, any town any club
Unless you busy, you can party wit us
'Till the mornin' come, then we on the run
Then we do it again - cause that's how it is
On them ones, playa that's how it is
Talk money? it's done that, just biz
I get it on lock like ""that's just a bid""
Every time I rock it's like ""that's just the kid""
If you didn't know, now you know
Gotta get this paper, gotta go gotta go
[Chorus: x 2]"
take-you-home,2002,angie-martinez,Hip-Hop,"I got a call from my girls around eight about that Friday spot
Round 12 hit the highway stop, I need gas
Car behind me on my ass, speed pass
Turn the radio on that's my joint got me and I need to dance
Pull up in the truck and it ain't my man's
You screaming ""hey yo"", you don't got a chance
Son, you are speaking a language I don't understand
Know the dude I hang with, I don't hold his hand
Cause, me, I'm free to choose
It's possible to leave with you
When we get through, I drive passenger seat for you
Let's ride
At one I arrive
Walked past the line
Damn his ass is fine
Some guy now we up in the spot
Watch
Place hot
Couple of bottles champagne popped
And that's how we doing it now
I'm scheming while the DJ's moving the crowd
[Chorus: x2]
I was wondering if I could take you home
Would ya still love me baby, if I could take you home
I was wondering if I could take you home
Would ya still love me baby, if I could take you home
It's around 2 A.M.
The mood is trend
The club is snug
I see him watching, love is love
Caught him when I looked up, gave him a glance
Promotion chick walked over while I'm shaking her hand
I'm looking over her
Sorry but I'm waiting for this man
Is what I told her, so she could leave
No breaking up my plans
No time for talking about shows
Or dates that I could host
Damn, he walking over to me, they breaking out the jokes
My girls laughing
They see me already imagining
He whispered in my ear, would I dance with him
I answered him
He took my hand with him
Dancing close
I turned around and gave him my back, he passed a smoke
He put his hand on my hip, then my stomach
He must want it
And I was really just 'bout to leave, his clique fronted
Like they don't see
That they man 'bout to tell 'em peace
And to think, I wasn't even gonna go out..see?
[Chorus]
All I need is my lip gloss, I.D., gum, and I'm straight
Especially if it's Envy in bungalow eight
We making it hot on the dance floor today
But my girls want to leave cause there's nothing to take
Nothing to meet
Spot dead, nothing to see
Then we all agree that we won't leave
Cause some spots the papi's still come at three
That's when I tell the DJ to run that please
He dancing behind me
I feel what's under his jeans
And I had one too many so I'm under his scheme
I mean I'm cool and the gang
The music is playing
Think I found what I'm looking for, no purpose in waiting
Almost time for breakfast
Standing by the coat checkers
Looking for my parking lot ticket, that's it
And this night just ended
Can't say with who, what, or where but it'll definitely be remembered
[Chorus]
Would you be my boyfriend?
Would you be my boyfriend?
Would you be my boyfriend?
For tonight only
Would you be my boyfriend?
Would you be my boyfriend?
Would you be my boyfriend?
For tonight only"
fucked-up-situation,2002,angie-martinez,Hip-Hop,"The brightest diamonds ever known
Yeah, Angie mar
T-Ice, take it to the record
I wish you understood how I feel 'cause these words is real
After that bullshit I couldn't prefer to chill
But tell you what you deserve to get
But I still sat back and heard your shit
You said chill it was the shit but come on I deserve to be mad
That whole situation was bad, I wish there was one of those moments in
I could break and just laugh but it was too serious to take what I had
I mean what I had was deep it's still deep but damn
It's sad to see how one weekend could be like damn
One situation see I can in, have type of relation he's my man
Or he's my nigga or, he's my try to understand
Please pa, honest is the plan and I don't mean
Please pa, beggin' with my hands I mean like
Please pa, I got feelings, damn
See, I know what you're facing, this fucked up situation
And maybe she might like me or may even dislike me
'Cause baby you're a part of me and baby it's just hard to see
That you complained everyday but you would love me anyway
Ah yea I know know I was wrong too I made the wrong move
I went and looked through something that belonged to you
And I found out suttin' I was all confused mixed emotions coming
Feeling all abused
Shocked when I read me you was calling boo
Dropped it and I left slowed down no talking to you
You'll never understand how I felt waking downstairs
And you knew something was wrong but I had to finish that song
Couple minutes didn't really take me that long
Still feeling confused but I had to go strong and attract
And relax, sit back then you came in and you asked what's wrong
The fact is displaying
I didn't have to say it stop playing
Shit, at that point even you knew I was ok to flip
How could you no matter what you thought we was
Just go around the word called love come on
See, I know what you're facing, this fucked up situation
And maybe she might like me or may even dislike me
'Cause baby you're a part of me and baby it's just hard to see
That you complained everyday but you would love me anyway
Thats exactly how it is, exactly what I'm talking about
Exactly where it'll end up this song after I'm walkin' out
Niggas don't understand when you give them your all
How many times you hang up when you're dying to call
Try to dial his numbers and you start with the first four
And when you get to seven your heart beat like you're eleven
I learned my lesson and I waive if there was any
I still try to understand shit with out no henny
Just a clear mind while you're thinking it's just smear rhymes
I gotta go through this shit and still report fine
And get on air be clear animal for real each year
The bullshit going on I'm prepared
I ain't the only one, chicks be going through it
Niggas don't understand we be borderline losing it
And these feelings is real so like I said in the first verse
I wish you understood how I feel for real
See, I know what you're facing, this fucked up situation
And maybe she might like me or may even dislike me
'Cause baby you're a part of me and baby it's just hard to see
That you complained everyday but you would love me anyway"
so-good,2002,angie-martinez,Hip-Hop,"[Angie]
He was all I wanted, late night talkin',
On the phone till daylight often,
At home he came through, dinner on the table,
Plate bites lost him, the love was strong then,
We went for walks then, then I lost him,
I mean he's still her but I ignore him,
'cause he's too busy for me,
He comes around a few minutes then leave,
Things ain't the way they used to be,
Then I met this guy right down the street,
And this is what he said to me
Hello good lookin', tell me how are you,
Every time I see you baby, lookin' so
Good,let me show you girl, I can be so good
I tried to work things out, bring things back
Arguments started, you don't know how to act,
Could a brought up the fact, that today I met this new dude,
And I don't need the say it, he probably would a thought I was playin',
And he probably would a said stop playin',
But this bullshit I'm about to stop, takin',
'Cause this new guy's about to drop, waitin',
I ain't playin, he played him self,
Need space need time, oh well, you can have all the space in the world, and
Your man might have found a new girl
Even though you don't know me, what can I do,
Let me see you girl, one Saturday afternoon,
Let me show you girl, I can be so good
Every girl need's affection, not somebody who's stressin',
Hope he learned his lesson, 'cause in one direction,
You can't see to the left and, you're stuck wit a dumb fuck,
Who don't understand that one truck, don't matter to you,
No car crib either, just you and him in a two seat a,
But they always find out when its too late,
Tellin' me to wait, no you wait,
Wait till you see me in his arms,
And understand that I'm gone
Hello good lookin', tell me how are you,
I see you girl, walkin' that avenue,
Let me show you girl, I can be so good"
a-new-day,2002,angie-martinez,Hip-Hop,"[Intro: A. Martinez]
Yo, uh
The animals are here
It's a new day...yo yo uh
It's about being close to the ground
like dope fiends and not even fallin'
Some people frontin' now they keep callin'
But that's life, ain't no grudge in my heart
I could sleep mornings, that's the business
I just keep that shit apart, that's the wisdom
In my position get hard, I deal wit people from far
Very few I keep close, that's how you keep from the scars
You gotta move like a ghost, cause some people are stars
And all of a sudden.. they forgot who they are
But look at me I'm still Angie, back wit a plan be
It's a new day you could sit down or stand me
I just try to be an example, bringin' the animal out
When everybody doubting underhand me
Its ample time, If you could not see the big picture
Cause there's plenty ladies like me I'm a big sista
Always on the grind through whatever you say
And just incase you ain't clear its okay
It's a new day!
[Chours1: 2x]
If you need it to be, (uh) Then it can be (yea)
It happen for me, It's a new day (a new day)
[Chours2: 2x]
Keep hoping, Keep focus
Approaching, up, A new day
Reaction to my first verse in a year it was clearly unexpected
Me on a record, We must yea agree it was hectic
Getting here half sleep and eating breakfast in my chair
How I feel, it's a new day now, that's for real
I was prepared to deal wit, whatever was given
People dissecting what I'm spitting on, not giving me a chance
Listen and understand, they ain't know how to react
Off my 16 bars on that track, ""She out or she back Damn""
Then came a record (""If I could go"")
I'm not saying my shits perfected
But if I could go's the beginning accept it, connected
You already know, yes is an automatic question
Automatically answered cause I'm flowing like you never heard
Why second one it can't be said in words
Except it had to be done, in other words I'm leaving on top
You mad at me huh, believe it won't stop
The love it's much stronger you can not break my hunger
[Chorus1: 2x]
[Chorus2: 2x]
See they love for you to give up, can't wait for you to slip up
As soon as you hit rock bottom, they never picking you up
Or never picking you out, they always out when you pick
But when your outfits is sick, or you got a hit
Then every other word is, ""No Doubt,
When can we go out, When can we grab lunch,"" I only get mad once
Cause when you get mad twice you sacrifice then a punch
And then a situation jumps so I grab a blunt
Roll it and spark it cause you media targets
Pictures is blatant ya know what I'm saying
This ain't ancient this is today shit
but it's a new day shit no games get played shit
No time get wasted, I learn from the worst situations (""yep"")
And I made it, everything I had in my heart I pushed and gave it
So when I say it's a new day I mean it
Cause when it's the truth you must agree shit!

Haters 'n haters you better be clear
Or you'll be kissin' my pussy on the rear
What I'm talking 'bout, with my filthy mouth, from the Dirty South

Ain't nobody does it easy-seezy
And ain't nobody got the dick to sling me (ow!)
God damn, what's that sound?
Didn't I tell you I'm about to shake it down
I'm no punk, but a killa like Cam
Get on the flo', yes yes mam

Insecure bitch watch yo man!
Me and Ang like butter on toast
I don't mean to boast, but we do
[Angie:] I need that yea
[Chorus]
Hello-oh? oh that's my ears ringing
I'm sitting here thinking that sound is still bangin'
As we leavin' the spot I'm still drinking
Gotta' leave cause the cops are still waiting
So we circle the block, as we workin' to blot
Then purposely watch, we so blingin'
And the truck is bright, light up the night
Blinking, as we stuck in the chair feel like we sinking
That sound still drowned the air waves
The echo in my head feel like a bear cave
So I sit back to the sound of this track
Playin' on my way home, I can't forget that
That beat when you hear from the street
Make you want to get on the floor and don't even speak
Cause it don't even matter who be around
Get, and that's DJ Keith, playin' that sound (I need that)

With wrath and doom, so cruel and foul,
Replete with obscene joy.
Replete with obscene joy.
Replete with obscene joy.

And through our ghastly dreams
His twisting turning tentacles
Elicit from us maddened screams.

Smoke a sweet, to the beat, if it's good
Put it on the beat, gotta have alot fun before you get too old

Take a little time out for yourself

Waited years to get a premier and did it from here

Take you back to the 80's around
Polo Grounds, Uptown, eight-eighty a pound
Niggaz hit the rooftop, y'all was roofin the rocks
Other niggaz shoe tops, only youth on the block
You dig me - movin in tops and movin these rocks

Yo, this is for the way we rock
Thinkin' Bad Boy gonna stop, we not
Yo, we step up in the scene like oh!
You hear their flow and then there they go
In the Range Ro' see the ringers go blind
There the brain go every single time
Put it in perspective, reflection in step
Step to the left while I rep it to the death
Easily approached, smokin' on the roach in coach
til I'm so high I'm on another plane
Hey, every fucking spot we go, we just rock you see now we know
Fuckin' news cameras they want to get the footage
want to grind out find out where my hood is
Let's just say that this is how we put it, down
why'all niggas cool out and lounge
Fuck around, radios down this
Say we go round this bullshit straight to the plate
Now, every fucking spot we go

Look what the pound did, not like the brown kid
Then look around 'cause you're quite surrounded
Fight the rounds but can't find the rounds

Wide big Lincoln, why's this guy on the side for the stinking?
Watch task force dash forward lookin marveled
It's a big chance, big pants, might guard him

Got so many spots I don't even buy luggage, ya love it

Tired of putting broke niggaz under the wing

everyday,2001,g-dep,Hip-Hop,"A yo, I walk down the block with my stomach in knots
Spent time hustling, running from cops
Broke as a joke, no ends at all
Can't play ball and my Timbs is small
Can't buy trees with government cheese
I rather be where its breeze, niggas bubbling ki's
My moms got two jobs one on her knees
and writin letters to the governor ""Please call off the deeds""
My baby mother with another brother with cash
and drive by roll down the window and laugh
I solve all my problems with indo and hash
Bought my daughter a Nintendo now she calling it Dad
My landlord's a jerk, the water don't work
My little sister twelve and she bought her own skirt
Rather do Kirk than do her homework
Talk blunts and boys and she'll jump for joy
Shit's twisted, opportunity not but I missed it
Out in the park gettin lifted
So now I'm sittin here shit out of luck without a buck
and it don't make a difference
So do you hear me?
'Cause if you don't I'll come up close and say it clearly
I got to know I got to go
I strive for my pay each and every way
but this type of shit it happens everyday
It's like I'm trapped in a maze walk around in a daze
I won't rest 'til I'm paid or I'm down in my grave
I want to look tough, but my sneakers is scuffed
Everyday pants in the week is enough
I had a little money but it came and it went
Now its either pay the rent or stay in a tent
and it don't make sense how the shit is intense
and all you got up in your pocket is lint, you get the hint?
I had a cigarette for breakfast, just for beginners
Cried for my lunch and sleep for dinner
I tried to go to church, priest called me a sinner
He called me everything except for a winner
I'm walking in the rain wishing things would change
It ain't a game, mad I pawned all the rings and chains
Emotionally scarred form losing my job
Pass the nod nigga, times is hard
[CHORUS]
So do you hear me?
'Cause if you don't I'll come up close and say it clearly
I got to know, I got to go
I strive for my pay each and every way
but this type of shit it happens everyday
Now would you check me?
If I was you and you was me, would you respect me?
I got to know I got to go
I strive for my pay each and every way
but this type of shit it happens everyday
I ain't gonna front, all I want is a blunt
a pair of blue and yellow dunks and my hundreds in chunks
But, people see me, put they purse to the front
I'm waking up early on the first of the month
Honeys don't respect when you call 'em collect
and it's 25 cent you can call 'em direct
I put my life on the line I ain't making a dime
Nigga call me ""Never mind , man you're wastin' your time""
A yo, I'm livin' in the ghetto and I'm tryin' to survive
At the same time a nigga rolling by in a five
Can find a drive for a 9-5
It's like I only get by when I'm feeling the high
And I ain't got no smoke, the elevator broke
I'm at the end of my rope tryin to find a way to cope
I'm sipping on Gin thinking how I could win
I don't know where it begins but this is where it could end

'Cause yo, I'm about to blast off -
Straight to the chase, cause everybody know what's the case
Aiyyo, I'ma about to blast off
Straight to the point, aiyyo, yo, light another joint
Nigga, I'ma blast off
Right to the top, aiyyo, no, I ain't gon stop yo
Nigga, I'ma blast off
Straight to the dome, you entered in the Bad Boy zone
[Mark Curry]
Yo, yo, uh
Who's a nigga harder than me?
On the boats, make it known how the slaughterin' be
Damn, Curry ain't the shit? Put the name in your mouth
Got it different? You ain't on what you talkin' about
Bustin' off in her mouth, catch me
I'm feelin' for whoever test me, pity for whoever second guess me
Know how to ?manhand'? it's real as it get
Feelin' my shit, straight through the cealin' with this
Bet your block love it, find me only with the grimy
Gutters of the street where my mind be
Play the game, get you a 'zil'
Forever, put you until, it fit me to kill
Heat, got it with me still
Flip the game over, see me, we be, untouched
Out like your motherfuckin' guns bust, BLAOW
Sure shot, hit again, spit it grim, anytime, anyplace
Bitch, I'm about to-
[G. Dep]
Blast off, yo I get it poppin'
When I rock, yo it's non-stoppin'
Yo, I'm about to blast off
See me at the show, when I rock everybody know
Aiyyo, I'm about to blast off
Bottles gon' pop, cause when I rock, everybody rock
Aiyyo, I'm about to blast off
Straight to the top, cause everybody know this is hot
[Loon]
Aiyyo son, I'm about to blast off, like an astronaut
Niggas don't want to see a nigga blast the glock
Niggas don't want to see a nigga flash the rocks
And pop up in the flashy drop - motherfuckers
Niggas know me, Loon's a gunslinger
Fuck fightin' a nigga, I'm usin' one finger
Catch one of you rap cats in the 'Humdinger'
Some niggas get shot, livin' with 'pump-singers'
Expect to die, I'd rather sit in a chair, electrified
This thing here, testify
But, other than that though, we never get caught
We ?Joy Jefferson? walk, out of federal court
We came ready in ?thought?, ain't better the sport
So whatever you thought, you can use whatever support
But, I think it's best you go 'head and just walk
Or have the cops find traces of lead in your corpse
Yo, I'm about to-
[G. Dep]
Blast off-
Straight to the chase, cause everybody know what's the case
Aiyyo, I'ma about to blast off
Straight to the point, aiyyo, yo, light another joint

Right to the top, aiyyo, no, I ain't gon stop yo
Nigga, I'ma blast off
Straight to the dome, you entered in the Bad Boy zone"
the-ride,2001,g-dep,Hip-Hop,"[Verse 1]
First off, how you gon' come off
All this rap shit, get done off
Man listen this a passionate mind
I come through, gun drew splashin a rhyme
Wet dat, dead dat, cash on the line
In an orderly fashion in the back'a the line
Can't talk now, I got cash on tha mind
Bitches and dolla signs dance in they mind
I love dat doe, but y'all niggas love dat flow
Man I don't love dat hoe
All I see is cash flow
Brains an occasional ass hole
What I need is a, whole lotta money involved
I might run into Rob and run in ya job
Real cats take chances
Then I make ya +head spin+ like +break dancers+
[Chorus]
My niggas in the front don't front
My niggas in the back, where you at
My niggas on the side, bout to slide
My niggas in the middle we rock just a little
Then we ride, the ride
My bitches in the front don't front
My bitches in the back, where you at
My bitches on the side, bout to slide
My bitches in the middle we rock just a little
Then we ride, the ride
[Verse 2]
If raps don't work, need ta put some in
I hear y'all knockin' but ya can't come in
Said I'd get cha, wrote the scripture
Chick roastin like motion picture
Have you any idea, how many nice MC's
And how many I feared - None
Just trust me son, I do what must be done
And I just begun, I let em-
Count sheep, rock em to sleep
Got me, cocking the heat, poppin a Jeep
Let's go, Expo top of the line
Exo, Yes ho, hoppin in mine, I got a-
Big Bad Boy you could meet
Men use beef and its all you can eat, I be the-
Dep with a G in the front
Front, fuck around and be in a trunk
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
Ain't no games if you're curious be
Can't be serious G, seriously, I'm out ta-
Put a big hole in the joint
Like I, sold her the joint, told her to point, its like-
Mind over matter with this
Mad Hatter with this, battle with this
Like a +sentence+, it just +run-on+
I'm pro and you a princess, come on
y'all ain't ready, ain't crazy and ya name ain't Eddie
And ya aim ain't steady
Dream big boy but ya chain ain't heavy
Brain ain't ready, my game ain't petty
Must be stupid or somethin'
Thinkin' this all love like Cupid or somethin'
Live from the 2-1-2
One question: What you gon' do?
[Chorus Til Fade]"
special-delivery,2001,g-dep,Hip-Hop,"[Verse 1]
Yo, this for my niggas, though, special delivery
Spit like this, get my wrists all glittery
Get cake, snakes get slithery
Lean in, show why'all the meaning of chivalry
Rap ruler, you could ask Buddha
Right jab like Zab Zuda
Every member on my team is the shooter
Tight like a womb, no room for intruders
Spark Buddha, twistin' the Philly
And Good Humor, don't be silly
It's gravy baby, I got it all smothered
Like makeup, I got it all covered
Want a jewel, don't be cruel
It's authentic, don't be fooled
By these phony accusations
Backlash and slanders
Front, and they put pits in ya
Stunts and propaganda
Keep it private, 'cause I'm the commander
In chief, I never stop like beef
Gimme a break, I might shake the building place
Say vacate all women and children
I spit it out
[Chorus (repeat 2x)]
Special delivery
I want that
Special delivery
I need
Special delivery
Can I have that
Special delivery
Come give it to me
[Verse 2]
If you ain't ready, I'ma bust through ya curtain
Encore, you're not sure, I'm certain
Wait, make sure the mic workin'
Make cake, sorta like Earth Wind
And Fire, the rap vampire
Retire in the morn'
Warm like campfires
Matter of fact, I'm blazin'
Raisin' the roof up
Slide off with ya rooster
Took her to the stu and seduced her
Let her do a skit, then she hit my producer (Oh)
Not whatcha used to, I'm looser
Ya need to stop fuckin' with them losers, now who's up
The mystic ruler, grand imperial
Filthy, but milky like cereal
Bang this in ya stereo
MC's is dead and I'ma get head up at they burial
And that's disrespectful
I'm strong like Exo mixed with X, yo
And that's the high capability
And yes, I possess that ability
I spit it out
[Chorus (repeat 2x)]
[Verse 3]
Yeah, ayo, Dep so bright, light looking halogen
Spit that bar, car low mileagin'
Let's go, metropolitan
Area, 'cause I'm hearin' ya hollerin'
The earthquaker, Harlem bread maker
Gimme two hands, few grams and the shaker
Hit the block, watch the kids bake up
Your girl keep coming around
Then I'ma take her to Jamaica
And I give her a reason to get curious
But ya pain, it ain't that serious
MC's ran with this and that
But change your name to Saran 'cause it's a Wrap
Your rap is like a sedative
You sleepy, defeat me, negative
So it's over and I guess you gotta live with it
And you can tell by the records that's distributed
I spit it out"

Coming rambo style nigga
2 guns up
why'all niggaz better duck down
I'll get your cap lifted off
that's how we doing it for the new millennium you heard
[G Dep]
Regardless of the wait i'm gonna stay straight ghetto
Everybody high, don't nobody say hello
Even when the sunshining it ain't yellow
Get out of the borough
If you know it ain't thorough
Niggas play ball, AWOL, on the furlow
Still came down on the furl and pumped hero
Red and grey Macs
Keep it clean as Ajax
Ghettos sling cracks
While you niggas pay tax
Now how ghetto is this
you can catch me in your hallway taking a piss
One hand on my dick one hand on a spliff
Burnt lips from the roach clip, yellow tips
If we ain't closed it I get ferocious
Know this whole shit will leave me in them roaches
In your car motion I cause commotion
And i probably need some lotion
But i don't get fucked

I am

A ghetto nigga you can tell in a talk
On the corner selling the snort
It's hell in New York
Won't stop for a minute cops telling you hawk
Fake guards telling you pork
Settle for shorts
Running from court
New ports, criminal thoughts
On the blocks bodies acourt
Nobody supports

It's a ghetto nigga thorough niggas that get cake
Five boroughs of niggaz do his ? a ? flip weight
Change garments to trick Jake, you dis jake
I want it yo I got warrants in six states
They come in a stolen whip with switched plates
Stickers hate I never leave a bread to trace
Only evidence I leave is hickies on chicks' face
In the corner with the crooked niggas
But yo shit's straight
We start war to leave with these seven revolvers
Sell case never test the floor
Sticky yank slicking enough why'all
I'm a man enough to put on a dress
To creep up like grand-moma and bust why'all
Get close enough to part your vest and tux off
Who would have thought the lady with the car would crush why'all
Too smart to get caught
But I got fam up north
So if they put me in coughs
I'll call fuck why'all
[CHORUS]
[Kool G Rap]
Knock back the hammer smell the
Pop that cantelope
For the venom in my python spit
It ain't no antidote
Jackpot from crack blocks
I was a man of dope
Snapshots to get your camera broke
You hoes used to plan a gross
With the hands toast
Close and stand opposed
Rubber bands she knows
Grams of the coke
Razor blade tuck the side the line
The banter of the coke
Watching niggas die with my hand on their doe
Singing with the bass
And wash up the ?land? when they float
Choking on your own words
Should have watched the ground when you spoke
One last final approach
Make your whole family ghost
Bust bottles of cham and and we toast
Till your photo stamped in the post
Sex gland cut off jammed in you're throat
Man are you gross
Bitch hanging from the lampost
We shoot from up close
Blow canners the most
Catch an overdose
Nigga we own the coast

I was worser than them.
I was wild as a child and got worser at 10. When
I start dislikin the rules like it was cool.
Actin a fool, fightin, bringin knifes to my school.
I cooled down at 13 and start mackin the whores,
that's when I fell back and started actin mature.
I hit the scene at 15 and started gettin a name cuz I was rhymin and grindin, I was gettin the change.
A couple years later got down with the team.
I was signed to Ruff Ryders movin pounds of the green.
I did a groove album, but I aint get a release,
that's when I politiced with Swiss and started rippin his beats.
But I was still hittin the streets and sellin the cain.

Then I'll pour some more and start twirlin' then
And might go and get my pipes up by your girl and them
If you a thug, stop girlin' then
If I see a car in traffic, I'm a jacket like Burlington
It's Cassidy, who's thorough as him, nobody
I keep a gun tucked cause I don't trust nobody
I got plenty biscuits
And ya'll niggaz like skinny bitches y'all ain't got nobodies
Watch how you talk to me man
Before you faggots get smacked with the dark skin part of my
Hand
Understand?
[Chorus]
I'm the best in building, a prospect destined for millions
Threat to civilians and my blood pressure is building
Catch feelings? You be wet, catchin' a steel in
Weapons directed, at ya' chest, neck and ya' grill and
Still, there's no regrets, but I confessed that I kill men
I spill men's blood on the rug next to there children
And if you wan' set it? Cass' bettin' his deal in
Yes I will win, when I spill extra appealin'
Come to Limekill, we got them exstasy pills and
Got the whip fully equipped except for the ceilin'
I got a stash in it, the Smith-n-Wessun can chill in
I might get arressted, but until then?
[Chorus]
If I hear you gettin' chips, pitbulls where you sleepin'
Everybody on the fuckin' floor, I'm squeezin'
Click the four, grip your whore by her weave and
Bitch, what muthafuckin' drawer is the keys in?
Got you on your knees like a braud and you pleadin'
(Uh, you got it dog, take it all, I don't need it)
I'll clap you and have you on your carpet, bleedin'
Throw your stuff in the trunk of the Ford then I'm leavin'
Now I got a raw load more than I'm needin'
And that's the reason, why you and whore is screamin'
Pull this, squeezed then if you holdin' them hammers
I'm focused like disposable cameras, nigga!

take-it,2004,cassidy,Hip-Hop,"[Chorus]
Shake it I want to see you shake it
I ain't gon' fake it I want to see you naked it
Girl you got figure make a nigga want to taste it
Lay your face on the pillow cases
And see if you can take it
Yeah dis cat in the business
600 on the back of my benzes
It's nothin
I lay back in my drop and get my roll on
I took my old jon back to the lot like take it
And my shit be mind blown
Big face watch 5 different time zones
And they ain't rinestones
They a couple of thou
And this just one of my styles so take it
[Chorus]
Daddy you know I want to shake it
The way I shake it make you want to break it
Ain't nothin' stop frontin' what's poppin' boo
If you want it all you got to do is come take it
Daddy I know you gon' make it
And when you make it you still gon' take it
Stand up if you makin' somethin'
Stand up if you takin' somethin' OK?
Some niggas want to live this life but can't live it
I know what it's like to want it and can't get it
I know what it's like to be broke
That's why every time I get a good price on a shit
I'ma take it
Everything I write is a quote
And for that butta you be bitin the toast
I'm back on my grissel and my raps official
Any chance I get to clap my shit man i'ma take it
You should ride for ya man and if worst come to worst
You should die for ya man
But if I run up and pull it and shoot at your man
Would you jump in front of the bullet and take it
[Chorus]
If it ain't one thing damn it's anotha'
Hand in hand I sold grams of butta
Man I was drug dealin 'cause I love the feelin' of handin' a couple grand
To my motha like take it
Look I'm off the chain
I get all the bitches all the brain
My sound goin' down in the hall of fame
And all y'all gon' call the name Cassidy
And i'ma take it flip it bounce it and switch it up

Listen up wit the mic in my hand it's like I got ya life in my hands and
Ima take it

Okay!
I was told you ain't got it nice, 'til you got a wife
But nope I'ma baller 'cause, never gon fall in love
Pshyche that's a damn lie
Ladies put ya hands high every woman should get that one man to stand by
It's called devotion, emotions could make a man cry
But ma wipe ya tears and just stare in that man eyes
Prove that you there for him, prove that you care for him
That's how you gotta act, prove that you got his back
Prove that you not a rat
Don't creep and ho around, hold him down
'Cause you know what comes around goes around
And I'm older now and it might seem kinda weird
But man all them damn AIDS commercials got me kinda scared
[Chorus]
[Verse 2 (Snoop Dogg)]
You ever laid on some pink mink sheets blowin' swishers
Holdin' on some champagne while doin ya damn thang
Caressin' on tha world main
Adressin'' you is no pain
Betty Wright is playing, no pain no gain
I did it for the hell of it
Hit it now you tell a bitch
Now she want a little bit, I did it for the smell of it
It's relevant and evident
Yeah girl you heaven sent
I love the way you break and take all the evidence
Pimpin cause I'm stayin in your mothafucking residence
While you out bringin me back the dead presidents
(Pimpin', Pimpin', Pimpin')
You can say that I got you
I do it cause I have to, plus I feel like I got you
[Chorus]
[Verse 3 (Cassidy)]
Sis if you make love to me
Kissin' and huggin' me
Lickin' and rubbin' me, it'll get ugly
The bed got a mink spread gettin all cuddley
Pop bub' the hot tub gettin all bubbley
You don't even gotta ask, all my girls got it bad
Closet full of Prada bags and I ain't even gotta brag
Yeah I keep them lookin real
Go 'head you can push the wheel
And if ya face tough I might wake up and cook a meal
Whatever you ask for (It's yours)
We can go to my bungalo over in Tahiti with the glass floors
Fish swimmin 'round, the moonlight shimmer down
I got the bomb stroke
Girl get ya spine broke

interpretation-of-the-industry,2004,cassidy,Hip-Hop,"Okay.
This joint is knockin' right here
I don't even need to write to this joint this easy
I'mma just talk to 'em off the top, listen
My interpretation of what the game facin'
I'm basin' my facts on ancient civilization
And my proclamation plus the world and its foundation
My education is statin' black unification
Debatin' whether Satin is situatin'
And placin' me in a state of mind that can't be shaken
It's like a leech slurrin' my specch, energy taken
It's brakin' my fiberglass thoughts that pass through my mental
Lettin' off frustration through meditation in conventional
Dimension in teleportation
And like the length between words in the first grade my mind is spacin'
Out on route like telephone communications through nations
Give me 360 degree rotations my occupation
Spittin' flows and creatin' a creation through experimental situations
They drug me ''cause my thoughts bloody like menstruations
Makin' my temperature heat up like incubation
They tracin' and chasin' from location to location
I'm stationed at a hotel accomidation
Waitin' to start me and my squad organization
But I'm hesitatin', too many outside irritations
Makin' me pause and might cause altercations
But I'm penetratin', surpassin' so-called limitations
Dedication, motivation and concentration
Manifestation is the key to escalation
And fluctuation of cheese might cause MC's suffocation
Or tax on cats ''cause no jacks is bein' fakin'
They typically pissin' me off like urination
Deflation and toleration is in consideration
But me in my rankin' is like Bob Marley to Jamaicans
I might be...slightly exaggeratin' but eliminatin'
These snakes wit affiliation got the system scared
Like mice durin' extermination
Erasin' the rhymes rapper's lines wit time and patience
Takin' no shorts, thoughts like woo blunts I'm lacin'
Comin' down like condensation givin' proper information
My interpretation of the rap business
Since my christenin' I wanted to be a rap technician
Splittin' mics in half for my fans when I'm spittin'
Never forgettin' how rap started from the beginnin'
But most of these ignorant rappers talkin' 'bout money they gettin'
Bars they spittin', cars they whippin', nice clothes they dipped in
Hoes they hittin', 9's they grippin'
But they gotta expand they mind and rhyme somethin' different
For instance, that's what I be kickin' in my writtens
But if you listen pay attention positivity's mentioned
My composition has a 50 slash 50 division
I can please both crowds no vocals is my intentions
When I do that wit rap I expand my comprehension
Extendin' my knowledge like goin' to college at Princeton
The industry's missin' and interpretation that's sickenin'
They was wishin' I presented so now I'm forever in it
The business..."

Neva been a toe steppa, side switcher
A fence jumper, I was ten wit ten pumpers
Hustled wit the best of dem

They runnin from us 'cause they petrified

Longer than the knife that I cut you wit

Front that shit this the south side, got a fat dick on your mouth wide
I've come to take outside, nah do it right here
Hop out later owning on everybody's home that you fuckin' with
Wheezy F baby, please say the baby
Riding with your bitch got keys on the lady
Triple gold these four tires on the whip
Young Carter sliding out I'm flyer than the whip
Yeah, higher than an angel, or hotter than the devil
The pot or kettle, uh
The metal let 'em burn like Ursha but worse, uh
If there's any beef I come Ron like Mertz, uh
Word up, eagle street I'm throwing my curve up
We take your ice cream and turn you into sherbert
I got flow I'm like ""Sure"" but, if it's about dough I'm like ""Sure 'nuff""
I'm from the bird bunch, Birdman Jr. you niggaz bird lunch
I see your lips moving but I ain't heard much
You see the wirst moving, it look like pure punch
I hear the playa hating but I don't endorse such
I got the Escalade, guts like the tour bus
I got the styrofoam poured up with syrup
And in the tires little package is gone
Might I spend a good deal with these Firestones
I spit like Myer's bones, born in chromers
For the buyers chromosomes I got summers
I got vicadens, valiums I ain't stopping
Got pot and heroin, ex, oxycontin
And that's how we rocking
How can you hear that bop unless I'm be-bopping
Yeah skip when you hear that click

Weezy Baby, ugh!
That's what I'm talking about
Now Fab, spit at these niggaz and let them know why they ain't fuckin' with you
Your goddamn right I'm feeling myself
A chauffeur no sir, I'm wheeling myself
Looking for a chick chilling for self
So I can show her the suicides and talk her into killing herself
I'm having problems dealing with wealth
But you wouldn't understand it, until you get a million yourself
You niggaz must've got a deal for your health
Your cd is frozen food, it just chills on the shelf
I spend big, at any time I can start splurging
The twin cigs open chests like a heart surgeon
And I'm buttoned up, I'm just a blue collar crook
But I keep a stack thick as few college books
I got a new polished look
And twenty dime bitches, to show y'all niggaz how my two dollars look
The boy's got at least six digits on
So the guns gotta be at least midget long
The money, is like ten bridges long
I throw bread around just to turn pigeons on
I got some good smoke just for puffers
The two grand twenty's make the hustlers suffer
Plus it's fluffer, than a cotton ball
I've gotten calls wanting me to put the pot in malls
But nowadays you can't put it past 'em
I got a Dan Marino arm, I'm bout to throw some bullets past 'em
And the niggaz in the hood keep quoting my lines
I don't jump ship I keep floating in mine
Long as I keep toting I'm fine
I'mma have these dick sucking niggaz deep-throating the nine
I jumped in the English ship, Benzed whip
It's Terminator 2 chrome the engines dip
I'm reading scripts no, not the penmanship (no)
The box-office shit (yeah), I box off this bitch (yeah)
Jessica Alba, Kirsten Dunst
And still make a mil' off the first of months

Is it because I'm Black
Is it because I'm Black
When you black you got to hustle, got to struggle and strive.
And not every cat that goes through that struggle survive.
But he got to stay stronger and keep the struggle alive.
They say the struggle died, I say the struggle revived.
My profession is going through oppression.
That's why I'm so stressed and I'm working with no rest,
And no question ima fight for y'all cause I don't like it y'all,
We make half as much as them, we workin twice as hard yall.
It ain't fair sometimes you seein heaven signs, I ain't Pharaohcon
But I got knowledge and I'm sharing mines. I swear its time to
Be aware that they fear you mind, and they fear your heart. You
Want to change here's the start. I'm tired of watching cops outline
My peers and y'all, I'm trying to make a move, I'm not trying to make
The news. They say the consequences worst when we break the
Rules. To get back and right you got to make a sacrifice.
[Chorus]
We got some problems we need solve, here's our chance to get them handle.
Just take the boycott in Alabama for example. They stop ridin the bus till they
Address their affairs. And they ended segregation in less then a year. So imagine
What our status if we made a contribution, we'll probably be able to change the
Constitution. I can't see no other kind of solution we deserve our reparation, its
Time for a revolutions. I'm a step ahead of Satan, I read it in Revelation. Forget
Your reputation, lets make it a better nation, cause they trying to cage us in,
Make us slaves again, eventually its meant to be the new plantation, the penitentiary.
For centuries they had a plan we let them executed, everyday another brother getting
Executed. And all our artist getting arrested I aspect improvement. It's a message
In the music, I suggest you use it.
[Chorus]
On the streets its hard to survive.
Why, is it because I'm black,
Hot Shot got rock, I can't bring my cousin back.
Five-hundred thousand sold, gold, yeah it wasn't platinum,
But Clyde gave me another try, cause I wasn't whack.
And now I'm buzzin back, yeah I got my budget back.
Renegotiating got a mil to do a dozen tracks.
Yea I'm eatin only reason is because I rap,
my homies eatin only reason is because of crack.
They can't get a job so them niggas quick to rob, quick to steal,
Quick to kill, grip the steal, quick to ride.
Malcolm X, Martin Luther King we can't forget them guys.
These politician, hypocrites they got us hypnotize.
That why I kiss rick, why, we got to lift our eyes.
Cause if we keep 'em close they just goin keep control.
And hold our sisters and brothers in the pen and we was born guilty
Cause the color of our skin"

I still move work, from the A.M. to the P.M.
Niggaz got beef, I'ma spray 'em when I see 'em
I punk on the street from the A.M. to the P.M.
Nigga want beef, I'ma spray 'em when I see 'em
Lay 'em when I see 'em, AK 'em when I see 'em
Hop out the Bronco, I'll O.J. 'em when I see 'em
Cut a bone out his skin, fish fo-lay 'em when I see 'em
N' wire is real, Kanye 'em when I see 'em
On their job, so I'll pay 'em when I see 'em
Turn boys to men I'll wine Yayo when I see 'em
Cause I'll be on the grid from the pm to the am
Paint pictures with my rhymes, you can see 'em when I say 'em
My songs like movies you can see 'em when you play them
If a nigga want beef, when I see 'em I'ma spray 'em
For six g's I could get your wip swiss cheesed
I'm like a red nose pit, you a mixed bread
Bitch please all 'em dudes in your crew ass
I'll get you strangled with the strings on your doo-rag

I'ma let you talk all stupid, till you get harked all stupid
Sparked out stupid, outlined in charcoal stupid
Dog I bite I don't bark all stupid, it is what it is
I'm in the coupe room droped all stupid
Fitted hat cocked all stupid, gettin' top off stupid
My clientele cop all stupid
We excels on the block all stupid, it is what it is
It's a fact that I rap all stupid
Get your wig pushed back all stupid
We strapped all stupid, I'll get you clapped all stupid
Don't let the pills and the yack make you act all stupid
Yeah I do my thing all stupid, let my chain bling all stupid
My ring all stupid and my earring all stupid
I got them things and I swing all stupid
[Chorus]
Yo, with my flow you all amazed and astonished
I've been hot since I got my first Sega with Sonic
Back in the days when Shawn Kemp played for the sonics
I rocked the huge jeans and I played the atonics
You know I blow A'z, I'll be blazing the chronic
It got my mind scrambled the and egg and an omelette
I talk to God every day, and he made me a promise
Me and T like, Malcolm and Alasia mahomie
Me and Swizz like Martin and Jessy
But the fact that I can get assassinated, is startin to stress me
I ain't tryna let the police department arrest me
But I still keep the steel tucked under the fresh tee
And I ain't just rapin for my health
So before you diss me, you be betta off laughin at yourself
Cause I ain't tryna battle on the mic
I have them goons hop out on you like they did Harrell at the light"

Y'all niggas is crazy
(To think) y'all niggas can't fade me
(Trick these) From the bottom to the top, from the booth to the block
Anyway I got to get it, I'm givin' it all I got
Y'all haters can't hold me.
(No Way) And y'all don't want to zone me
(Want it your way) So when I get, I'm gon' get it, in my life how I live it
And whips I be whippin', smokin' on the exquisite
In the crib, two bricks of coke, liquor and dope
Pretty Hawaiian bitches who eat choch and deep throat
Same niggas that get down, remember them
California style, yeah I went back again
But much wiser, 'cause these guys are
Leave you up shits creek and won't lose sleep
So while we pack the heat, I got the heckler and koch
My man got the dot, five-oh block
It's like the movies shots as niggas watch
But the American version
East coast, west coast as we connect these curtains
'Cause we ain't scared to buck, step on the Timbs and Chuck's
Is gonna happen, gun clappin', remember that
Now we on the southern part of the map
Houston, party of the year, everybody there
Texas, no guest list, only real players allowed
Me and my dudes make out rounds
Y'all must be crazy
[Chorus]
VA game spittin', platinum grill grinnin'
Chrome rims spinnin', with wood grain glistenin'
Any amount we sippin', passion for thugs livin'
Free, fresh and out of prison
Flexin' that new edition
Good grain gettin', shit and lovin' the feelin'
Bobby Womack singin', Marisa Rings gleaming
Hat cocked duce, puffin the quarter loosely
Poppin' the bottle and tippin' fifth of that to goosey
Shinnin' for Swill and Halle, smokin' for Lil' Shawney
Still reppin' Bad Newz, and all my soldiers for me
Enjoy some better days, dispute burdens I carry
See cousin hookin' money, for God momentary
Floss every chance I get, spread love freely
Still spittin' gangsta shit, 'cause the streets need me
Still got that mack with me, for niggas actin silly
Still pimpin' gangsta pretty, reppin' in every city
[Chorus]
Yeah, I pray every day for a better life
I think it's gon' get better but it's like I'm never right
Make about it Christ, I'm on both of my knees
There's no hope, that why I'm smokin' the trees
Damn, all for the chees, I lost both of my mans
That's why this toast is in the both of my hands
Damn, and I'll sell coke and birds 'fore I go to work
I go to the Range more than I go to church
My whole mentality twisted, but this reality isn't it
I ain't tryin' to be fatality listed
And yo reverend, gettin dough is like goin' to heaven
And goin' to jail, like goin' to hell
But before I go in the grave, I'll go in the cell
Just send my son mo' dough in the mail
Oh well, but I got god on my side so I'm beatin' the case
This life crazy but I'm keepin' the faith"
on-the-grind,2005,cassidy,Hip-Hop,"Yeah
Cassidy, yeah
Uh, I'm out here on the grind
I'm out here on the grind tryna get a little change
When niggaz tryna shine just to get a little name
They act a little funny and they talk a little strange
But they need to get they money and enjoy a little fame
Cause I'm out here on the grind tryna get a little change
When niggaz tryna shine just to get a little name
They act a little funny and they talk a little strange
But they need to get they money and enjoy a little fame
I was told it's a crazy world, well I was born crazy too
1982, they said I was a baby who
Always started trouble, start to hustle what they made me do
As I grew as a man, my plans and my gravy grew
Coke, I copped a little, posted on the block a little
My block popped a little even though my rocks was little
But now a nigga grown started sellin bigger stones
Got a steady clientele that can't leave the shit alone
Keep it on the hivic homes, can't leave ya shit at home
If I spit it, I did it, I lived it, we can get it on
Forget it, I'm sick with it, the midget'll get shitted on
You don't wanna get the chrome, you wanna getcha phone
You don't wanna brawl at all, you wanna call the law
But if you get called a snitch, you might as well call it quits
And I might answer the phone when ya call ya bitch
I push bars like rod, this shit all will flip
Man I'm out here on the grind
I'm out here on the grind
I'm out here on the grind
I do this for the hood and I do this for the streets
I do this for my peeps cause my family gotta eat
I do this for the thugs that be hustling the drugs
I do this for my niggaz who be bustin all the slugs
I'd do this for the love but I do this to get paid
I do this for my niggaz in the cells and in the graves
I do this for my niggaz on the block that keep it thorough
I do this for all the hustlers around the world
Cause I'm out here on the grind
Don't abuse the fame, use ya brain fore you open ya mouth
Or you could get poked ouch with the toast in ya mouth
I doubt I'ma go broke, I be done broke in ya house
You don't hustle just cause niggaz cook coke in ya house
If I stop sellin coke, it'll drought
And my flow so dope, I got insurance on my throat and my mouth
I change the game, my name gets spoken about
I'm still ill with the smoke in my mouth (whoa)
Ya sis oped, and I'ma open her blouse
Stick my dick down her throat and start stroking her mouth (whoa)
I let my unborns float in her mouth
And then I put a condom on and start stroking her out (whoa)
I blow the hydro to the scout
On the post with the rock inside got most of the clout
And most of the cash I'm bragging and boasting about
Copped a yacht and got a dock, I can float to the house
Got damn, you wouldn't understand how I'm feeling man
I'm chilling man, all for the love of drug dealing man
I got change I'm gon borrow
That's why I got a quarter million dollar painting hanging on my wall
So naw, I ain't pressed for paper
But I'm dealing weight and got real estate tryna stretch the paper
It's best to invest the paper
But if you wanna battle, let's bet, I could use the extra paper
Cause I'd do whatever to eat
I'm from the street, if it's beef, it's whatever, I ain't never been sweet
And in a battle, I ain't never been beat
I'm in the race to take Jay-Z place, and you ain't better than Bleek
When I speak, you can tell that I'm wise
Dog, I got the best punch lines since Big L was alive
And this was a big L so I'm already high
If a nigga better than me, then he already died

I do this for the hood and I do this for the streets

Crack! for the money you know how we play, we sell that c-r-a-c-k
[Chorus]
Crack! It got my niggaz addicted
Crack! But got my niggaz convicted
Crack! Why niggaz stand on the block
Its called crack! It got my man and 'em shot
I said crack! What niggaz sell for the cash
Crack! Got the women selling they ass
Crack! What the feins use to get high
And the hustlers move to get by that's why the song called crack!
I got the cops drawn, I put the block on
Over rare 'bout to stock piles of the popcorn
Feins got the block warm getting they cop on
My young'ns run the block till ev'ry one of the rocks gone
And I got another block I'm puttin' the pot on
Strong enough to smell through the jar wit the top on
Cop and be gone, if you come to the block drawn
I'll hit you with the glock till ev'ry one of the shots gone
He thought he was a thug he was all on his pop join'
Till he got popped now he all on his rock join'
I left him all on the block wit his top gone
Law called his mom and pop they all on they shock join'
I was just tryna make some bread for my family
And ev'rybody got somebody dead in they family
And ev'rybody got some crackheads in they family
So it's no room to hate cause I kno you relate, my shit
[Chorus]
I'ma blow like propane cause the flow flames
It'll have you look like the cooked version of cocaine
I spit crack homie, neva been wak homie
I'm back homie, and I hold weight like I'm fat Tony
Like a soprano I stay with the ammo
Push keys and make music but don't play the piano
You could get blam! Yo, I'm nice wit my hands doe
You'll be looking like Rocky if you play like you Rambo
I'm looking type rocky when I hop out the land vo
Bezel on the band whoa, rock on the hand glow
It's all for the fans doe
Thanks for the sup-port
My sixteen's like the nicotine in a Newport
I'm like Too $hort, pimpin' these hoes
I'm the best at inventin' the flow since hove
What these other niggaz spittin' is trash
But it's like hittin' a glass when you listen to cass, my shit
[Chorus]
I still be fucking it all up
Gettin' it, mixin' it cuttin', it all up
I make hella cake and I'm addin' it all up
And I ain't sellin' weight, man I'm baggin' it all up
My youngn's on the block they be knockin' it all off
Who you think the feins be coppin' it all off
My block got hard but we coppin' it all soft
If its snakes in the grass we choppin' it all off
If you play wit my cash I'm poppin' at all ya
Wit my face in a mask I'm choppin at all ya
But due to the fact I be rappin' and all that
I be actin' and all that I ain't clappin' at y'all cats
But before I did music and movies and all that
I was moving in all black wit the toolies and all that
But now I don't got time cause I'm eatin' and all that
I'm too decent for all that to be beefin' wit y'all cats, you on

Yes I (gotta stay strong)
And I (gotta keep it going)
So long (so long)
It's usually the beauty that attract me
But perhaps she was the right person,
Her personality made me happy and that's why I pursued her
I'm a dude that make manoeuvres
If I choose her then she whipped cause my dick as long as a ruler,
She maybe kind of crazy its cool long as I school her
I'm smooth as Grand Poobah and I can charm a computer,
For us to conversate all it take to make an impression
Like a teacher lecturing when I'm speaking she taking lessons,
But every time we argue and fight I feel like I'm dying,
I feel like trying tell you the truth,
You feel like I'm lyin but I'm a move on cause I'm strong as ever
Without you, I can do better but I can never forget about you girl.
[Chorus]
Ay yo I laced you with the girl braces when you was young,
Doing ya thang I went to amfye and buy you dem benaces,
Queen of the temple with the sent of a Lemon

Sexy, mean walk and your von gear we at the pond you all up
Under my arm when we shopping embracing your re-lock and gloks and tims

Up cause when I needed you, you never got flossed up a laced out lady with taste
I gotta just kiss ya face keep ya nigga growned these are the brakes. One!

Without her being close is depressing,
They say ain't nobody perfect but a honey rosted complexion
Close to perfection plus she got a body that could
Probably turn a gay man straight, to stay in shape mommy started taking karate,
So while she get it done in the gym runnin the treadmill I'm runnin for feds
Still, keep one in the bed still I be reminiscing boo,
Missin you that's dead real cause you nice in the bed
And you nice with the hand skills you awfully fine,
I can't get you off my mind, I ain't frontin yea I lost a dime
But you crossed the line and ain't follow directions you gone, gettin back together is out
Of the question, I moved on.

And start spitting like I'm missing a tooth
You listening duke, I'm gripping the coupe, lifting the roof
Sip the orange juice mixed with the goose
Or shots of the yak I got gats that could lift up a moose
Stay with a biscuit to shoot like I'm Bishop in Juice
I get more bitches than Luke when I run the block
Fiends scream ""I Wanna Rock, I Wanna Rock Ock""
I'm right in the curb white and the herb
And I got a nice price on the birds you might could get served
You come with the doe I come with the blow
But if you don't come with the change I'm a come with them thangs
Run up on you with the gun in the dickie
The collar coat hold a hundred and fifty

And I might pop her off if the chick is mean
I got some stories I can tell I'll sell a chick a dream
I'll let her sip a little liquor let her hit the green
Then I'm a unbutton her blouse and unzip her jeans
And merk that ass, hurt that ass

And I ain't with my boy Kells in the hotel no more
I'm on the strip making sells fish scale galore

I'm still acting a fool packing a tool
Went back to the dude before I was with the black and the jewels
I don't feel right if I ain't strapped with the tool
But give me a gat and I'm cool like the mac or the ooze
And I'll clap at you dudes I ain't scrapping you dudes
I'm kind of light and I ain't fighting I got ratchets to use
I'll have cats like ""Damn yo what happened to dude?""
Listen homey if I'm hungry you'll get jacked for your food
I'm back on the move, back on the grind
I'm a natural born hustler I just happened to rhyme
Who would of ever thought I'll be the cat to get signed
But life hard to predict the shit happen sometimes
Cats jacking my lines, taking my style
But there ain't no perpetrators aloud
If you die then you can't testify when I take it to trial
You can hate it I just take it and smile
Motherfucker

And my lil man feelin' the dutch while I chill in the cut
On my lean, chicks stealin' my stance
Chinese print on the jeans, chicks spillin' my pants
And I got the steel in my pants, don't grind on me
I can't dance I got the nine on me

Got your panani wet cause I'm fresh to the socks mami

like-that-girl,2005,fatty-koo,Hip-Hop,"[Verse 1:]
Tell me what should I do, what should I say.
I'm lost for words so I'm coming to you, sistas.
Will you help me, see I don't know, where to start, to find the keys to win over a woman's heart.
Well first, things to remember when your game comes into play.
Gain your composure show respect and you'll be okay, because the ladies really like it when.
When you don't succeed, don't get offended.
Listen when she speaks and don't pretend.
[Chorus:]
Ooh ooh ooh. I like that girl. [2x]
Yeah she says that she like you, too, but she's too shy come and talk to you so.
Boy, you have to make that move if you want her to be yours.
[Verse 2:]
Show me a man that will be me, love.
Love me for me.
I'm not asking much.
See true love don't come easily and if it's meant to be, it happens natuarlly.
If you don't look for love, it might actually find you.
Now tell me what you want, what you need.
Cause I be thinking ya'll be bout diamonds, pretty necklaces nice cars, bling bling.
I thought ya'll made it clear, love don't' cost a thing.
Tell me if I'm wrong or right.
I don't want to make the same mistake I made before, she walked out the door cause her love I ignored.
I just want to take my time and explore her world cause, truth be told, I really like this girl.
[Chorus]
Now it don't matter the size of your bankroll.
Cause I'm an independent women, I can take care of my own.
I don't care bout your escalade or your sprees sitting on chrome.
Cause when it comes to a woman, you need a girl that you can take home.
[Last chorus:]
Ooh ooh ooh I like that girl. [2x]
You know, mommy, you're the best thing I ever seen come round my way and i.
Want you to be down with me like I'm with you, yes, you, girl.
You know you drive me crazy.
Ooh ooh yeah.
You got me saying, ooh ooh yeah.
You got me going, ooh ooh yeah.
You got me singing, ooh ooh yeah.
I'm feeling everything ya'll been talking bout.
And for her it's time for me to kick the player out.
With no doubt it's been running through my mind.
Settling down, true love I have found, my world she's forever my sunshine.
My pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, see, love is not about the material. but it's mental heartfelt
And spiritual.
I like that girl yeah [4x]"

princess-in-disguise,2005,fatty-koo,Hip-Hop,"[Verse 1:]
Like a perfect ten in a magazine were the girls that caught my eyes
Sophisticated queen with the sex appeal
Beauty no less than a dime
But the girl that really caught my heart wasn't anything like that at first glance you wouldn't see it...
But she was really bad
-papasito, venconmigo
-dejame demostrar a ti
-que tu no puedes ver
-la mujer (marya-dentro) de mi
[Chorus:]
She's just an average girl
Ain't got no mink and pearls still she's like royalty
She's a princess in disguise
She's got a heart of gold
Within a tale untold, that's where her beauty lies
She's a princess in disguise
Her smile is like a twinkle in the sky
A diamond in the ruff with the heart of a child
Her true beauty is more then skin deep
Because the essence of a women is hidden underneath
[Chorus]
[Verse 2:]
-tomame al castillo que estan en los nubes
Hasme princesa de tu corazon, mi serviente de amor
Desde alli, viajar a otros lugares
Para vivir momentos inolvidables
You stole my heart and sealed it with a kiss
No matter where I look, it can't get no better than this
My princess, my goddess, you came from up above
I'll treat you like royalty, with all my love
Your heart is pure, together we explore
We build on honesty, one solid core
You caught my eye, I can't deny
You're in my heart, you are my pride"

I'm tired of you pushin' luck
It's all the stupid things that you do
That makes me so fed up with you (here we go)
Here you go talk talk talking again
Need to cut the act out cause its just pretend
What you say is not fair (no that ain't fair)
And if you know me better than you'll realize I don't care
But when you don't think (I don't care)
You do flawless things I'm just giving you fair warning
About the hurt and pain
I'm fine without caring don't try to scare me
Your words don't mean $hit to me so I won't let it get to me No
But who will be your friend that day when you fall
And when you need someone to talk to who can you call
No I don't need nobody else but me and myself
Don't mean to seem selfish but I can't help it

Wait a minute the bottom line
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right

She's you sister why can't you make up make the past be gone
So you can move on (Move on)

I was looking for all of the pain through your eyes
Don't do it
Don't do it to me

Like you, oh no
Why do we always need someone else
To lean up on and get the other half done for ya
Baby I don't need you
I don't need you honey
But I need you
Life, it's my preference, and I choose love
Because I trust in you

I'm contemplating just what to do
I invest my soul but I gotta change my truth
Oh, just 'cause he says he loves you
Doesn't mean that he do
Just 'cause he says he needs you
Doesn't mean that it's true
You know you really don't love him
You know he really don't care

To you he's another affair

I attempted to pretend, there's a means
Before we end, oh no
Shattered pieces of my heart
Mended though they fall apart
I don't need the questions on
Why I do what I do
'Cause I'm cold in every sense of the word
And you've been too
Take a slice of your strife
And multiply by two
When you look at me
'Cause that's the way I'm looking at you

Keep bringing you back to me
Just when I started to get myself together again
Thoughts of you come creeping in
Met at a party in June
Wasn't really tryin' to notice you
You looked at me with your sweet brown eyes
You walked up and said ""Hi""
Who would have known
That a love affair like ours would grow
Then slip away
Still miss that old skool love
Not quite that do-right love
Your love was fine, never old time
You're steady on my mind
Still miss that old skool love
I don't want you back
But I'll never ever love the same way again
Now here I am startin' over with a new love
He's a real man with a good heart
He's more than enough, laid back and smooth
With a warm and gentle touch
Near or far, his love is never, never too far
(There I go again)
Thinkin' about your lips when I'm kissing him
(There you go again)
Throwin' me back, makin' me reminisce
And I know it's wrong, me holding on
Thank you for being the one that I
Still miss that old skool love
Not quite that do-right love
Your love was fine, never old time
You're steady on my mind
Still miss that old skool love
I don't want you back
But I'll never ever love the same way again
Didn't ya tell me that ya never tell me lies
And didn't ya tell me that you'd never say goodbye
All of my heart, you tore it apart
Lord knows, your memory still remains
All that I know, just can't let go
Still miss that
Still miss that old skool love
Not quite that do-right love
Your love was fine, never old time
You're steady on my mind
Still miss that old skool love
I don't want you back
But I'll never ever love the same way again
I don't want you back, no no
I don't want you back
But I'll never ever love the same way again"
my-cryin-eyes,2005,divine-brown,Hip-Hop,"Oh its raining again
Hello my sweet baby, it's been a long long while since i heard you laugh out loud or i've seen you smile
I'm writing to you now baby, just to let you know
it hasn't been the same since i let you go you see
my heads all up in the clouds (up in the clouds)
and my mind is spinning like a merry-go-round
i admit it baby, i am to blame in showing you my heart i feel no shame, i wish it would rain, cause i keep crying tears from my eyes (tears from my eyes) emotional rain, boy i keep crying tears from my eyes, i remember when we used to talk, go out dancing, having fun, walking in the dark, you would whisper sweet things in my ear, saying how you long for me, sounding so sincere, then i called no reason, no right, and i said unexpected goodbye, i admit it baby, i know i was wrong, so i hold my head and cry and sing the same old song, i wish it would rain, cause i keep crying tears from my eyes (tears from my eyes) emotional rain, boy i keep crying tears from my eyes, singing ooh woo woo woo woo woo woo woo woo woo woo over you ooh baby my cyin eyes, my crying eyes, woo woo woo woo woo woo, ooh baby my cyin eyes, my crying eyes, woo woo woo woo woo woo baby my cyin eyes, said i miss you baby i love you baby i need you and i'm so sorry baby, ooh baby my cyin eyes"

american-psycho-ii-b-real,2004,d-12,Hip-Hop,"[Chorus - B-Real]
I'm a little bit off the chain, you can call me insane, but the fact remains
That I'm a psycho
Better get it through your brain was a pice of shit, when you say my name, never say it in vain
Cause I'm a psycho
[Verse 1 - Swift]
I'm a motherfuckin omen, I bow down to no man, I'll split a ***** open,
Killing folks compulsive, a soldier wit a motive, scrotum big as boulders,
I'll hold it then unload on you, put on poster, so everyone can notice who
Was focused on his pokin, they nose in our business, hopin that I don't come
Smoke 'em, No one knows my notions or emotions,I'm a vulture,
Close to croakin any moment,fage and I know when, I could suck the culture up,
Probably rap like crap, a maniac, wit anxiety attacks, I don't wanna chat, speak when
You spoken to, and I don't have to read a fuckin magazine or quote able, to notice
What you hoes'll do
[Verse 2 - Kuniva]
We all soldiers, we move as a unit, we all roll up, show up at your residence
And light your front door up, get scared, life ain't fair, and I'm prepared to blast you
Just as fast as dre can say hell yeah, so watch what you say, cause it can happen
Either today or the next minute, i can draw the heater and spray and I'm dead
Serious, you could be dead period, end of story bitch, I'm on your porch wit a gun and
Your son sippin a forty, No one can hold me, I does it all by my lonely,
Stomp your head while you awake, you'll be looking like gumby, Aftermath and Shady bitch
You can read it and weep, you see my poster in the hood for the G of the week
[Chorus]
[Verse 3 - Bizzare]
They found Saddam, but they ain't gonna find me, I'll be under a tree,
In Buttfuck Tennessee, and I don't know too much about my daddy,
Except he spit in my face and fucked me in my fanny, I ain't a racist
I just hate whites, fags and dykes, blacks and transvestites, 13 years old
And joined a fucking gang, hair under my ass cheeks feeling the fucking pain
Am I insane?, who really knows, cause any second my temper can fucking
Blow, I get colder than december, black the fuckin suck it out, tomorrow won't even remember
See Bizzare can show what violence is all about, and this Dr. Dre beat done brought it
The fuck out, run in your house and put it in your mouth, and blow your brains the fuck out
[Verse 4 - Eminem]
I probably got a screw loose or two or maybe three or four of 'em, some fell out and hit the floor,
All I know is ever since my fuckin head hit the snowbank, been a little niandrothol, no thanks to
My man D' Angelo Baily,but I just take it slow daily, my biggest delierence, tryin to figure whether
To use the flat head or the phillips, or just go to the Home Depot, and pick the new power drill up,
Its been two hours and 6 days and I'm still up, I feel like I'm about to snap and minute, there's a new
Tower Records, I'm bout to stop and get a fill-up, pick the new Cypress Hill up, and go find who did
That shit to Xzibit, and go fill up a whole liquor bottle wit piss and go shatter his fuckin lips wit it

d-12-world,2004,d-12,Hip-Hop,"Fuck the silly shit, I pull a mac milli quick,
When D12 rock this summer it's over with.
All these bitches and all these hoes,
What the fuck you looking at me for? (You, nigga!).
Oh yeah, you like my chain, want to get your skinny ass up in the Range.
I like my bitches raspy and nasty,
I like a fat and nasty bitch named Ashley
[Swift]
I slide you dope without no procrastination,
And you can watch me fuck up your imagination.
I'm always getting drunk, and I fiend to smack hoes,
I mean it, I leave them screamin' like pteorodactyls.
This is our world
[Kuniva]
We'd love to smack you,
Hot lead flying with debris and schrapnel.
Rippin' you to shreads, fuckin' up your tattoo.
Break into your crib, take your records and plaques too.
[Kon Artis]
D12 is, that's who!
Got you limpin'.
Still poppin' somethin' purple with a bottle of gin bitch!
I fuck up your kinship, I lie in this shit.
Peep, I stole your mom's jeep and crashed into my street.
[Proof]
Crazy, deranged, of course we Shady's gang,
Of course we wear clothes with holes and blood stains.
No doubt, we shoot badges, born with ski masks.
Chew on shrooms, drink booze, and pee acid.

Welcome to D12 World!
Where you can get anything from sex, X, to girls.
Welcome to D12 World!
Prostitutes and guns, so fuck the real world.

Hey yo
Niggas be talkin' shit, but they layin' slugs? now.
I graduated from techs, I grip a pump now.
I used to be nice, but nice don't cut it.
Now I over they wig, if they don't uppen my budget.
[Bizarre]
Them D12 niggas, they be quick to blast.
I take my shower cap off, and whup your ass.
Steppin' to us, you can't be the smartest,
Cause you'll get dropped like an Aftermath artist.
[Swift]
They catch me mingling by a bitch with class,
When she turn I'll be sprinkling some shit in her glass.
What part of this you can't understand?
I'll humiliate a man, worse then making a band.
[Kuniva]
Don't be mistakin' that man
[Kon Artist]
He'll invite you over
[Swift]
Real fast, and pass your ass a glass of ebola.
[Kon Artis]
I've been doing this for a minute,
And I'm starting to see my little brother (?brother's name prob?)
Look more like a star then me.
That's why I just started workin' out.
Man, this shit ain't workin' out."
commercial-break,2004,d-12,Hip-Hop,"Yo, testing.
This thing back on again.
Alright, perfect, God damn good.
Yo, this is Rondell Beene,
I'm back on the motherfuckin' scene,
And I'm upset as a motherfucker.
I mean first I didn't get paid for the D12 shit.
You heard me rippin' on there, they just edited my verse out.
Then I was on Obie's shit, I was in Obie's video,
And that Obie go ahead and I didn't get paid for that shit.
And now they got this bald head weed smokin' mother fucker,
And his name is

Young Zee, keep movin' for the macs. Be cubin'.
Hmm? I'll make you sing like big Ruben.
Man, in the hood, I'm the American Idol.
First I fight you, and then run up on your stairs with a rifle.
Bang
Tech claims make you wipe out like X-Games
Next sprain's in your motherfuckin' leg bang?
Tryin' to shoot me like they tryin' to shoot 50.
Either you gon' die or need a new kidney.
Till I drop, I'm a sell to your friends.
Till I get some of that tin, in the federal pin.
I spit better than them.
Niggas wanna fight me, better go get in the gym
Or the metal'll spin. Since smokes' in 'Nam,
Doin' drugs than Eminem moms.
Ten times, Dirty Dozen. All x times.
Bash your ride, crash when you drive,
Flip your dumbass out the passenger side."
leave-dat-boy-alone,2004,d-12,Hip-Hop,"[Chorus: Eminem]
Y'all better leave that boy alone
'cause if they don't
You know they going come back on 'em
And they don't want him to come back strong
I wouldn't dare get that boy going
I said leave that boy alone
'cause y'all don't know him
That there boy he out cold
And that there boy he been known
To stirr some shit up when he in that zone
[Bridge: x2]
Better leave that boy alone
Better leave that boy alone
Better leave that boy alone
'cause you don't want to get that boy goin
[Swift]
It's my attitude that's making me bust shit
I hate to be fucked with
So basically niggas wasting they time trying to touch Swift
I run with a bunch of killers that dealt with punks
Returning bows 'fore you be looking at yourself get stomped
I'm a dysfunctional bastard who will puncture your ass
With a mag and I'll be glad to send another one after you
Without no hesitation I run up in your house and wake your spouse up
And give her mouth to gun resuscitation
A niggas information, they hunted and they sad
Got you mad 'cause they shitting through their stomach in a bag
We coming too strong so its irrelevant to blast you
We master ready, slash like relatives of Manson
When you hear us niggas think it's elephants dancing
Coming here is the worse mistake that could ever happen
When I'm in my vehicle I'm pulling you in
I guarantee the world will never see you again
[Chorus]
[Kon]
Honest to god I usually try to keep to my self
But it's kinda hard when you surrounded by ignorants, well
Let me explain something to ya
A real street nigga ain't trying to get in the streets
He's trying to get out, feel me?
And he ain't the type of dude to pop a E and get drunk
And wave his heat all in the air like he's some dumb hoe punk
At least a soldier in the army lose his life over a cause
This nigga dying over prizes to prove he got balls
I play keyboards, I don't play deep
You borrow guns, I own shit that explode when it hit
You think it's wrong that you hoes thinking you can't really get sleep
'cause you laid a nigga down without any meat
Well my cops won't allow me to make decisions in vein
I'm a man I do my bidding and I do it again
If you take it to that level, I take it to whoever
Want to harm me and my family, Runyon Avenue forever
[Chorus]
[Kon]
Now people I live trifling I express it through writing
If you can't feel it, then I must express it through fighting
And I just bought me a new gauge and added on a knew knife
And I strike people so fast people think I threw lightning
Clash with a few titans, blasted a few height men
Been harassed by two dikes who wanted (lou pikner)
Plus you know I'm too violent, to be out with you whiling
'cause as soon as you driving I'm a spit a few 5 ones
And I love to Kunive son, and you left a live one
I know how to hide guns, skinny or wide ones
Go buy me a long sub and hide it inside buns
You looking for hoes, and up in here you going find none
You niggas get dropped once, and you can kiss my nuts
You soft little dry cunts, get stuck till your eyes shut
No time for the wild ones, I'm writing these five words
Fuck you dick riding niggas count it, it's five words.

6-in-the-morning,2004,d-12,Hip-Hop,"Good morning
Haha, wake your mother fucking asses up
Yo what is the what?
Well come on then, you know what time it is
Stop sleeping on my roof bitch!
For whatever it's worth it's worth me having my ass whipped
'Cause I'ma have the last lift that ever gets ass squished
I just can't get past these little peasants
That wanna be rauny bad asses so bad
And they so mad they can't stand it
Cause we can and they can't spit (Hawk)
And they can't handle it like a man
And that's when it just happens
And I snap and it's a wrap, and it's a scrap an then it isn't crap is it?
Hip-Hop isn't a sport anymore when you got to go and resort back into that shit
Maybe I'm old fashioned but my passion
Is to smash anyone rapping without having a slapping
Believe me I'd much rather pick up a pencil than a pistol but I'm pissed now
But it all depends on just how far it get's took on the mic
'Cause I'm telling you right now your not gonna like it
'Cause if I get pushed over the edge then I'm pulling you with me
You poke a stick at a big boy you get bit be
These words stick to you like crazy glue
When you diss me cause they just bounce off me like bullets do fifty!
I'm the beautiful-est thing and your gonna miss me when I'm gone
Like Kieth Murry when he threw a stool and hit a girl accidentally
I do this for Swifty, Kon and Kuniva, Bizzy & Proof are you with me?
[Chorus]
Come on an everybody come on an
Kick your shoes off mother fuckers come on an
Cause we get it on an till the break of dawn an
Wake your ass up motherfuckers quit yawning
'Cause we ain't leaving till 6 in the morning
So have sing along with the words to the song an
If you don't know the words an you can't sing along an
Fake like you know 'em motherfucking join in
Everybody come on an
Its in the media pitted me of a beef starter
In a party with heat it's hard to keep me without one
Fuck slugs I'm walkin' gloves with a shotgun
Constantly popping slugs they hot son, better not run
The bosses of all bosses a Holocaust to whoever ain't conscious
In a house full of dog shit,
I'ma gothic death project, you stop breathing
You die quicker than mach speed without bleeding
It ain't about what you reading
When you meet me better speak like a season's greetings
Either that or we'll be beefing free when
You niggas need a 'E' just to speak shit!
Your leader is a boutique bitch
Keep the heater where you can reach quick
I snipe you with it and we won't even keep it a secret
Nigga I did it from a mind of a mental patient
When glocks wave you can save that conversation for Satan
You brave?
[Chorus]
Yo yo I heard you niggas don't like us
But so what this beef is like
'What the fuck did he say in his rap Em?'
I can see that he's just a punk
I mean these niggas squeeze on me
Please I'm seeing guts
I don't need no enemies, as my family a couple trucks
Am I empty seeing them white I empty out them white to fight you
In front of every reporter that I don't like
No need for metaphors I get yours across when I write
So emotions enough to say ""fuck you bitch, and I don't like you, WHAT!""
I might as well give this up like heavy sales
And just fuck an leave D12 and this blunt
We can't self destruct
I've never felt it this much
Come on fellas, get up
We got to fight like Bugs last night of his life
I walk with a limp, pistol hanging off-a the hip
I'm awkward and quick enough an sick when sparking a fifth
Your carcass is split even the beef is partially thick
We can't take you serious, you a comedy skit
You probably wish that you could be out shooting them G's
But the only thing you shoot is the breeze
I can't believe you speaking on moving key's
But every time we hear you kick it
The only thing you selling is wolf tickets
I look wicked cause niggas will test your nut sack
So when they bust you better bust back
And get your guts clapped outa your stomach
And when they want it (yeah)
I bring a hundred niggas from runave
So get your gun and if you coming

you are the one, you are the one, you are the one, ooh oooh.
Amazed by the way that you shake them hips,
shakin' your ass off in my dick.
I get aroused by them sexy lips cause
you are the one, you are the one, we are the one that can do.
And you wonder why I call you everyday of the week,
and have that operator breakin' on your line when you speak.
And I can say that I'ma make you mine in a blink.
You nominated just for your behind and I'm ?,
you a thug with your best of friend, mud-wrestlin'.
Sittin' in the corner with a mug and a cup of gin.
See me lookin' for you when you win in a pen,
see I hug you dirty. You confronting me for flirtin'?
You wanted me so suddenly, my company's a burden,
but I won't jump a balcony, and how can I be hurtin'.
I'm just playin' wit you and it's workin'.
Your friend's can't save you, they fakin' like they nurses.
First time I saw you, up in them guests,
you the only reason I use Federal Express.
Shit, I don't be havin' no packages. Naw,
I'm getting dressers, lamps, and big matresses.
I go crazy when I smell your odor.
I just want to pick you up, and take you to Pan-De-Rosa.
Steak and potatoes, whatever you want.
I'll write just the buffet, my publics check then come.
You don't care about D12, you don't know about Bizarre.
All you know that I'm weird and I wear a wonder-bra.
That's fine, I just want to make you mine.
niggas say you a 3, I think you a dime.
I love the way yo' body grindin', gettin' all in my face.
Only thing on your mind is which wallet to ?.
Your ass looks so perfect with your thong on your waist,
built like a stallion, you belong in a race.
Get money by the barrel, King Kong in the place.
Movie and a dinner, that's as long as I wait.
Hey, I ain't on your ear off, talkin' dates.
Got you dizzy of the crissy, you ain't walkin' straight.
Got a roomy, bring your booty, and lets cultivate.
You so pretty, love them titties, they soft and fake.
Bring your friends, ""Damn your skin smell like coffeecake.""

Fifty cent!, G Unit!, Here we go!, Free Yayo!
Motherfucker!, Benzino!, They don't know we finna' blow!
Someone better tell them so
You don't me, McVay and I doubt if you understand me
Why would I give a fuck about you if we ain't family?
I roll with a chosen few, and those of you that's behind me
Witness the most potest' ferocious niggas that rhyme
These bitches turn they back on you, actin' like they ain't did shit
When you rappin' never mix business up with your friendship
If you lackin' up in this jungle, then what you breathe for?
Niggas don't love you, you got habits of breaking street codes
Far as static, I automaticly get medieval
When I'm after people, then I'll explode you bitches with see-4
These hoe's, have no insurance, bodies get repo'
Making you vanish even when we ain't got our heat close
Keepin' .44's where you're hoes are swallowing deep throat
If you owe me dough then you know you falling asleep, close
Niggas pupils that's what I do, I'm foolish will shoot you
'Cause I'm coo-coo, But I don't think niggas can take in heat tho'
See I'm a man, and a man gon' do what he gotta do
And he ain't really family if he ain't loyal to you
If they was really soldiers then they would do what we do
And be loyal to crew and crew was loyal to you
I don't give a fuck, I'm quick to blaze chronic
Smoke on so much green, use twelves and supersonic
Bizarre pack guns and knives, put to dick to nuns and wife's
Now who the fuck want to fight?
Ain't nobody fucking with me, Ain't nobody fucking with the D'
They get beat like a M-P
You heard about Bizarre taking all them drugs
You heard about Proof wilding in the clubs
You heard about that nine that Eminem packs
You diss us, you get you're fucking face cracked
I'm from 7 Mile and stout, I'll shoot up you're house
Next day, I'll pee in you're mouth.
Aiyyo, loyalty's first, all the bullshit second
I showed you on the record, Cheers to who respect it
Most of these niggas neglect it
Even though it's a known method
From the hectic hood that you slept in
You want to' be an exeption
That's when the weapon is leaving you're half stepping
With that 'caine in you're left hand
Obie from a section that'll stain up you're flesh and
Have you on bare breast
Questionin' you're affection for streets
D-Twizzie no question
One of the best groups that done it
And Obie is their reflection
Lil' homey that know sowly that loyalty is reckin'
D-Twizzie fo' life, Obie Trice is second
Which one of you niggas want to be abolition bump heads
When I got a passion for clappin', with one hand
Talent's on my roster this mobster's in dump land
Send a gangsta to sleep two by two like bunk beds
Never leave the crib without packing my black burner
On some T. Ali rapper to merk a have murder
Incorporated, Hitman Harry is at you're service
Reach for me one more gain' and that's closed
For life as D12, no ice and spreewells
Every night that I chill in, I fight by free-will
Knowing I can be killed
Leaving my group, pieces of proof with a reason to shoot
And a license to ill
We lost Bugz and I'll be damned if we loose another man from our clan
Without forcing our hand
Escorting you're family, I'll torture you're granny
For my niggas, I'm on you're motherfucking porch with a 'Cammy
Yo its funny how niggas get caught along (and get bombed on)
Knocking teeth in back of you're throat (and break you're jaw bone)
(I'm on ignorant shit) these niggas is bitch
Pass me a cigarette quick (shit is finna' get thick)
Yo' man I'll get split (by a brutal and critical hit)
With identical dent (or bullets with identical prints)
I'm wishing you if (you come you're Lutenints a snitch)
You teminant fick (and we know you ain't finna' do shit)

Ain't going no were like the drugs outta Kim

Get a eye full of lid when I slight you're lights out
With a street cleaner, whipe you're life out
Bullets know at you're ears, like a Tyson fight bout

Back to these pictures I was trying to get developed
This man tried to get in front of me, I wouldn't let him
I'm ready to blow this bitches brains out

These words are weapons, I never show no emotion
My words are weapons, I use them to kill who ever's steppin' to me
My words are like weaponry on a record
The rage I release on a page, is like a demon unleashed in a cage
Lunatics soon as i hit the stage, my mind is like a fuckin' stick of dynamite
Once I get behind a mic its like the wick is lit
You bitches die tonight, my nine inch dick shinin' bright
My fuckin' grip is tighter than my wifes vagina
These cock suckin' cops got my Smith and Western
I guess its time to pick a different weapon, man this shits depressing.
But swift gettin' me a new one for a Christmas present
Come on slim lets go and teach this fuckin' bitch a lesson
They managed to confiscate the pistol that I ?
But the plan is to use this bullshit to my advantage.
Shady stay creative baby, hold your head up don't you let ?
One bit on these motherfuckin' suckers, your a soldier get up
Stand up for what you believe in, as long as you breathin'
They jealous of you man that the only reason they beeffin'

Its that Dirty dozen renegade, who done pulled the pin outta my grenade

See I'm dirty so I ain't gotta buy a pistol cleaner
An official beater don't lemme see you wid your heater you gets wet wid it,
Tell the motherfuckers Swift did it, packin' summit special in your crib, bitch get it,
Physically fitted to run your digits, I'm pastel with this rascal pointin' up your nostrils
You can split it and guess what we blowin' up the hospital
We wouldn't give a fuck if you a cop or a hoe, I'm Hannibal Lector
This vinal cord disconnector findin' whores to lock them up in motels to inject her

I'm eatin' crews like I'm Hannibal
There's no way I could be the gay rapper (why not) I only fuck animals
Stupid trick got my dick startin' to itch
Went to my mothers grave site and called her a stupid bitch
One on One in this blunt sport
I'm in divorce court
Suein' my bitch over a pack of newports
Six times I've been arrested
How would you feel if you were a Jehovah's Witness and always gettin' molested
I'm smokin' dank and drinkin' drink, I can't have any kids
Cause I'm fuckin' shootin' blanks
Don't you know Bizzare don't give a fuck

That I wouldn't turn my niggas on to you when I hit ya.
I probably could forget ya if I hadn't been drunk,
But choke a dunkadunk, keep my mind on hump.
When my mind's on hump to me my .9's in the trunk,
And Denaun got a line for every fine bitch I hunt.
Not once, twice, but three times the lover
That your man is, and I'm a freak undercover.
I got plans for you, trick, I don't need a baby mother.
I got five of them motherfuckers tryin' to smother me already.
We can't go steady, but you can give me head.
Give me that, get the hell out my bed, and leave the shit.
My chap lips will cut nipples when breast fed,
And on the way, leave the bread with achman.
I'd love for you to stay but I got another date,
With a fat chick that eat cake on play skates.
She rubbed my funky ass feet and feed me grace
Plus my man in the closet ran out of videotape.

I'ma make this one thing clear,
Ain't no woman hear gon' ruin my career.
All the hell you doin' is pursuin' a dream,
That's when you find out that life ain't truly what it seems.
All these hoes be lyin', bullshittin' each other.
And why the hell Kobe Bryant didn't wear a rubber.
He might as well have went and told the hoe that he love her.
I'm sure as hell ain't gonna go to court for my mother,
Or my wife, and my sisters. so motherfuck a mistress.
They signin' a contract before these bitches hit this.
Never will a woman take me out that way.
I keep a car camera in there motherfuckin' face.

What's your name again? it doesn't matter.
My name is bizzy, a bodyguard for Mr. Mathers.
Sit down girl. let me get you a drink.
I'ma buy you a mink, and rape you in the sink.
From day one, I knew you was a hoe.
I put a rubber on my toe and fucked you some mo'.
Turn around, let me see your nasty ass.
Put on a Jason mask while I take off your maxi pads.

These hoes be on some bullshit. always tryin' to pull shit
Outta they ass. get mad and put you on blast.
Tell 'em bitches how she fucked you,
Sucked you, put it on you, boned you.
Yappin' off with they mouth sayin' she loved you.
All on your dick, callin' your phone, spazzin' and shit.
Havin' a fit until you feel like callin' it quits.
Then she starts callin' your chick,
Wantin' to fight. everytime you show up at a gig,
She front row with her friends. flippin' you off.
Follow you to the bar, the bathroom,
The parkin' lot, to the car, pissin' you off.
Until you blackout, now you and the hoe is having a scrap out.
You get locked up for assault and now you asked out.

How come, we don't even talk no more
And you don't even call no more
We don't barely keep in touch at all
And I don't even feel the same love when we hug no more
And I heard it through the grapevine
We been beefin now
After all the year we been down
Ain't no way no how
This bullshit can't be true
We family
Ain't a damn thing changed
Unless its you!
We were so young
So full of life and vibrance
Side by side, wherever you was riding, I went
So close, almost on some Bonnie and Clyde shit
When Ronnie died you was right by my side
With a shoulder to cry on and tissue to wipe my eyes
And a bucket to catch ever tear I cried inside it.
You even had the same type of childhood I did
Sometimes I just wanna know why is it that you succumb to yours
And mine I survived it. You ran the streets, I 9 to 5ed it
We grew up, grew apart as time went by us
And I blew up to both yours and mines surprises.
Now I feel a vibe I just can't describe it
Much as your pride tries to hide it. your cold
Your touch is just like ice.
And your eyes is a look of resentment.
.I can sense it and I don't like it.

It was my dream at first to be off spitting a verse
On my own album with a deal but shit got worse
Fore I came out I would of killed a nigga first
For I let him disrespect me, or check me over some
Worthless bitch that I wasn't with
I would of hit it and quit
But you were fitting to talk with her and tell her she was the shit
I told you don't get involved with her
You would smoke in the car with her
Coming outta the bar with her
Stumbling half drunk
Like you were husband and wife or something
But me catching her fucking other niggas must of hurt your pride or something
Cause you were opening your mouth to people like you wanted with me.
When all I tried to do was show that your bitch was shifty.
And every sister, fares and all the shit that I produced
You acting like I ain't your man and lying like she can't be loose.
But I am really your friend, I'm just trying to tell ya the truth.
Don't hate the game or the player
The one that's changing is you.
[Chorus]
Its gets lonely at the top cause my homie had to stop
Now we acting like I gotta live only for the block.
And homies in the hood only see me on the tube
So they gossip on the porch
Get ta speaking all rude. fools I used to rap wit all expect magic
Like my finger get to snapping
And poof it just happen.
But proof is just acting out the part he was thrown,
Shady made it so my babies ain't starving at home.
See the devil in your glance,
Since the ghetto we been friends, forever real intelligence,
That's forever till the end.
I peep the hatred in your eyes, and the Satan in your lies,
Ain't wasting my time with these snakes in disguise.
(How come) When you talk it's with bitter and spite?
(And how come) It's my fault for what you did with your life?
And every time I go to hear you play, you look away,
We barely embrace, you can't even look me in my face.

Wear the same pants that you wore from the day before
Baby and shake that ass like a whore
[Chorus:]
Yeah I'm talkin to you Bitch!! (get up and dance Bitch!)
Wiggle that ass Bitch!! (yeah that's it. yeah I called you a Bitch!)
What you going to do about it Bitch!?
Sit there and cry like a little Bitch!? Bitch!.
Get up and dance Bitch! (wiggle that ass Bitch!)
You little trash Bitch! (yeah that's it. yeah I called you a trash Bitch!)
Not trailer trash switch!
Take the person you with and exchange partners
[Kuniva]
Tell me that it ain't no hanging, and fuck calling home
Until you look at me before you answer the phone
When I flee, your ass can get as naked and be as free
As you wanna be freak
But I'm taking the key with me.
You ain't gonna get shit, so don't even ask
Disrespect my wishes, I'll beat your ass
Watch me coming home floor eating half of your doggy bag
And I leave laughing, while you calling me on the rag
I'm the type that might cut off the lights when I hit
And before she cut them on, Kuniva already switched!
Your ass ain't even riding with Swift unless your going
When I'm done, I throw you out and ask you where you going
[Bizarre]
Hoe ain't the only thing you call a girl
Slut, Tramp, (oh, how you doing sir?)
Ever since I was 8, I been starting to hate
I said fuck the Ho's, started eating cheese cake
Scrambled eggs and steak, strawberry's and grapes
Damn that sounds great, hold on wait (Bizzy)
Ok, back to the Bitch!es, wash the dishes after that
Give me stitches. a fucking half Indian chick, suck my dick
This time tomorrow, I won't remember shit
Got respect for a player, got on snoop gators
And they ain't now and laters Bitch!.
[Chorus]
[Kuniva, Kon Artis, Dina Rae]
Hey baby what's up with you
Hey yo your man here with you?
Nah, you single, I can tell (you came with them hoes didn't you)
No you need friends girl, excuse him
Mr. Lick It (Hey yo lets get this party cracking these Bitch!es ain't got Bitch!es)
Now you know he didn't mean that (come on you seen that)
(she all whining and shit, get this Bitch! a Kleenex)
(what did he say?)
Nothing, he said you seem stressed
(no, you got a big butt)
And you wearing your nice dress(cause I was gonna say)
(you wasn't gonna say shit)
(excuse me?)
He said Michael Jackson just got another face lift
(dumb hoe)
(oh, nigga!)
No, gumbo, he wanna cook it for you tonight
(Bitch!, what up though just fuck for a buck,
Do something strange for change, maybe holla for a dollar, just hop in the range)
(fuck both y'all niggas)
See I was trying to be polite, stank ass trick (oh someone jackin off tonight)
[Verse 5: Proof]
Why you a Bitch! but don't choke
I say the same to my momma
I got Christina, Brittany with me, shit
We banging Madonna
Watch her strip you on that 10 Bitch! ain't got change for a dollar
Blow your tongue and give kiss on your mouth you came with a condom
Quick out is the motto and just swallow breathe, swallow breathe, now swallow these e's
I know you moca lotti mommy's won't get down on your knees
You won't some money honey damn you must be outta your weave
Hit the telly fuck her belly you ain't gotta go weak
Plus you wanna be a mattie you need a lot of more sleep
I'm a pimp Bitch! don't be shy, show me them big tits
Your lipstick, I want it smeared all on my limp dick
For instance, busting nuts is only my interest
So princess, don't get your feelings hurt 'cause men just
Partying bullshit till she gargle and swallow my dick
I'm taking the train to Spain, don't bother calling Bitch!
[Chorus]
Yeah, you heard me Bitch!.
Did I studder stupid?
You ain't listening to the words of this song anyways
All you do is listen to the beats with your dumb ass (Bitch!)
Dancing, trying to get a nigga money in the club
With your stupid manuper self
I was talking bout you Do-do
You, you dumb Bitch!
You!
The one that want a drink but don't want to pay for it
Spend all the money you make all week on that dress
And I spill a drink on it, acting like I'm drunk when I'm not
I'm just trying to fuck!

eminem-my-band,2004,d-12,Hip-Hop,"I don't know dude
I think everyone's all jealous and shit 'cause I'm like the lead singer of a band dude
And I think everyone's got a fuckin' problem with me dude
And they need to take it up with me after the show
Because
These chicks don't even know the name of my band
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands
'Cause once I blow they know that I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead singer of my band
So I get off stage right and drop the mic
Walk up to the hot chicks and I'm all like
""Sup ladies, my name's Slim Shady.
I'm the lead singer in D12 baby""
They're all like ""Oh my God it's him""
""Becky oh my fuckin' God it's Eminem""
""I swear to fuckin' God dude you fuckin' rock""
""Please Marshall please let me suck your cock""
And by now the rest of the fellas get jealous
Especially when I drop the beat and do my acapellas
All the chicks start yellin', all the hot babes
Throw their bras and their shirt and their panties on stage
So like every single night they pick a fight with me
But when we fight it's kinda like sibling rivalry
Cuz they're back on stage the next night with me
Dude I just think you're tryna steal the light from me
Yesterday Kuniva tried to pull a knife on me
Cause I told him Jessica Alba's my wife to be
This rock star shit, it's the life for me
And all the other guys just despise me because
These chicks don't even know the name of my band
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands
'Cause once I blow they know that I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead singer of my band
My band
My band
My band
My band
My band
My band
Roxanne
My band
My band
You just wanna see a nigga backwards don't you
Hey dad how come we don't rap on Protools
Smash these vocals and do a performance
But we in the van and he in a tour bus
You don't want my autograph, yous a liar
And no I'm Swift (oh I thought you was Kuniva)
What the hell is wrong with that dressing room
'Cause my shit is lookin' smaller than a decimal
See I know how to rap, see it's simple but
All I did was read a Russell Simmons book
So I'm more intect, tryna get on the map
Doin' jumpin jacks whilin' get whipped on my back
Look at Em little punk ass thinkin' he the shit
Yeah I know man find himself takin on a flick
Hey I thought we had an interview with DJ Clue
No I had an interview not you two
You gonna be late for soundcheck
Man I ain't goin' to soundcheck
But our mics are screwed up and his always sound best
You know what man I'ma say somethin
Hey yo Em
You got somethin' to say?!
Man no
I thought you bout to tell him off, what's up
Man I'ma tell him when I feel like it, man shut up
And you ain't even back me up when we s'posed to be crew
When I was bout to talk right after you
I swear, I swear man
These chicks don't even know the name of my band
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands
'Cause once I blow they know that I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead singer of my band
They say the lead singers rock, but the group does not
Once we sold out arenas to the amusement park
I'm gonna let the world know that proof is hot
I should cut his mic off when the musics starts
Ready to snap on a dumbass fan
Every time I hear (Hey dude I love your band)
We ain't a band bitch we don't play instruments
So why he get 90 and we only get ten percent
And these guys they can find every area code
Bitch carry your own
Can't make it to the stage, security in my way
(Who the fuck are you? Where's Obie and Dre?!)
Goddammit I'm sick of this group
Time for me to go solo and make some loot
I told you I made the beats and wrote all the raps
Till Kon Artist slipped me some crack
Lose Yourself video I was in the back
Superman video I was in the back
Fuck the media, I got some suggestions
Fuck Marshall, ask us the questions
Like who's D12, how we get started
(What about Eminem?)
Bitch are you retarded?
Anyway I'm the popularest guy in the group
Big ass stomach, bitches think I'm cute (hey sexy)
50 told me to do situps to get buff
I did two and a half and then I couldn't get up
Fuck D12, I'm outta this band
I'm gonna start a group with the real Roxanne
Girl why cant you see your the only one for me
And it just tears my ass apart to know that you don't know my name
These chicks don't even know the name of my band(ha ha)
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands(Fuck Marshall)
Cuz once I blow I know that I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead singer of my band
My band
My band
My band
My band
My band
My band
My band
My band
My band
The hottest boy band in the world
D12!
I'm the lead singer of my band, I get all the girl's to take off their
Underpants
And the lead singer of my band, my salsa
Makes all the pretty girl's wan to dance
My salsa, look out for my next single, it's called My Salsa
My salsa, salsa, salsa, salsa, my salsa
Makes all the pretty girls wan to dance
And take off their underpants
My salsa makes all the pretty girls wan to dance
And take off their underpants, my salsa

good-die-young,2004,d-12,Hip-Hop,"Dog, I shouldn't have left, They wouldn't have tried this shit if I was wit ya
Maybe we would have picked another time
Or chose another way
Or maybe my prayers would have convinced him to choose another soul
Shit, its just me and my mentoni now
Man you look so peaceful now, how can I argue wit that
They say
[Chorus]
They say the good die young,
That's why I think that you should have fun (when your young)
'Cause time won't wait for no one (uh huh)
When God calls, you gotta go home (go home)
They say the good die young, (die young)
That's why I know that we gon' have fun,
In this life 'cause you only get one
When God comes for me, don't cry till I'm home
[Kon Artis]
Its true that everybody heard, there mama say every days like this
When you see, one of your friends die in the mist
In the struggle, went through circumstances
Arrested every day just to prove a point to a friend
Even then, accidents are prone to happen to any man
A woman is dumb enough to pretend
That her, God won't hold them accountable for sins
If they commit, they try to repent to ??
But I guess (that's just the way things go)
I was blessed to see 24 (24)
To wake up to that how my name is video
Motivated me to write what I wrote
And I knew my little brother sold dope
An mom and daddy want to move our road
I did it, I still got a lot to prove and show
I just which we ain't have to lose Bugz to the struggle
'cause you know
[Chorus]
[Bizzare]
I know you used to Bizzare on some silly shit
But Niggas in my cliq, is dying quick
In Detroit, niggas don't party
They pull a .44 out, snatch off bacardis
That's why I keep the pistol under the trunk
I'm 27 years old, too old to be getting jumped
And fuck rap, I miss Karnail Pitts, be	-you-g-z
Tattooed on my wrist
Me and you in the jeep, listen to ?? beats
Its a shame me and Fuzz don't even speak
I got married, my wife name is D
Peace to 31 and 51-50, miss you
[Kuniva]
I came back on that tragic, my phone rung
And Bizarres voice telling me, Bugz was gone home
It was like a knife piercing my chest and I couldn't breath
I didn't wanna accept it, didn't wanna believe it
I swear with this weight dog, I cried so hard
Literally, Denaun had to carry me to the car
While I stand in this booth now its tearin' me apart
But I had to let it out 'cause it was tearin' at my heart
'Cause he died over something so petty and so small
A human life is so very precious I hope y'all
Understand how I'm feeling 'cause I love you bugs
I wanna rhyme wit you, laugh wit you, hug you bugs
But I can't and you was so close to seeing dreams
A coward came along and took you away from the team
So don't mistake this track, its just another song
This goes out to everyone who lost a loved one
'Cause you know
[Chorus]
[Proof]
They say its never too late, to have an early childhood
If I could, turn back the hands of time, God should
Forgive what I did as a kid to run blocks
Now my dreams are just dream cops and gun shots
The fun stops when your homies up in a box
My dudey bole, rest his soul, snuffed by the cops
I use to smoke shit a lot, if there's a guy by me say something
If you love her so much why didn't you gave nothing
When he took my homie, snuck was only in 11th grade
Now I hope to see your face at the heaven gates
It ain't never late in the game, this hating remains
With a grudge to see slugs straight through my frame
My heart aches with the pain, the life in his breath
We gotta have fun now, there's only minutes left
In the depth, distress youngn's is sucked in
To get task my fallen homies I got enough
[Chorus]
[Swifty]
When I was younger I knew four brothers that wasn't wise
That crash and the driver died,
My partner on the passenger side was paralyzed
And I'm surprised by the look of that ride that the other peeps survived
Nine months later another one died
Somebody shot him in the side when he was starting up his ride
3 years go by, I made a hell of a run
And that's when funky got done, a joey playing wit guns
And ?, karty was my man
And reggy, I wish that I was wit you in that van
And Bugs if it wasn't for you
You know I wouldn't be standing in this booth,
That's the truth, I miss y'all
[Chorus: x2]"

Ain't no one special, special like you [4x]
I been searching, but your the one I want in my life baby [4x]
[eminem]
I'm reminiscing on your tenderness and the snuggling and teasing
Missing what I remember, kissing and hugging and squeezing
Bugging and weezing, I'm having trouble when breathing
It's even tougher when sleeping
But there's a couple of reasons that I'm suffering and grieving
For loving and leaving, you all I'm thinking of in the evening
You got my knees buckling and weakening
Thoughts of nothing but freaking that I'm struggling to keep in
And interrupt when I'm speaking
I got some game that I'm preparing to run
The way your lips sparkle and glare in the sun
You got your hair in a bun, no matter what you're wearing you stun
Cause your comparing to none, I wanna share in the fun
I feel a passionate lust when I'm imagining just us alone at last with a
Touch
I see you grasping to trust, but my intentions are good
The seed is passing in dust
I'm not asking to rush and answer immediately
I just wanna be there for you and you to be there for me
If you agree to repeat after me, I love you (I love you baby)
Cause I just need you to see, how much I'm eager to be
Your man legally wed, your love's keeping me fed
This is easily said, so you can lead or be led
If you care to be down cause ain't nobody like you no where to be found

I been searching, but your the one I want in my life baby [4x]

Baby it's all on you, it's you I call on boo
Let's set a day up so you can fall on through
We'll take a spin in a lexus you can chill for dinner and breakfast
Long enough to see how this gentleman sex'es
We'll start it out with caviar, don parigne
And then when it's a fact we are warm, carry on
We'll take it slow, see nobody will hurry things
I got the herbs the bacardi and hurricane
If daiquiris are in debate and not your thing that day
It's still all right cause I got minute maid and tangeray
Your an incredible one that's rare, in bed with edible underwear
You look impeccable, nothing compares
I dream of freaking you, the women that will speak it too so
It seems that there is not an end to things that we can do so
Now we all set to play, only thing left to say is
When you step away, baby but don't forget the neglicie"

What happened to that boy (yo)

What happened to that boy
He was talking shit we put a clap into that boy
Whoa, yeah, malicious, yeah
I heard they snitchin' on a player man say it ain't so
Even as a young'n they consigned me to blow
Witches claims why I'm worth my weight in gold
While they was taking baby steps from an 8th to an O
Word in the streets that can envy as me
Enough ice on that watch to make a nigga lose sleep
Magnified face help the bitch see clearly
9 on the waist hit the bitch up severely
I'm know for the flip of that coke I ener
I'm heavy in the street like the 7 series Bimma
Man, hit 'em with the Nina man
Or that 4/5th guaranteed to lean ya man (Whoa)
I'm the reason that your block is vacant
Malicious will hit ya just to make a statement
Bitch! Clipse and Cash Money who ain't rich
Don't compare me to you nigga you ain't this (Whoa)
[Chorus]
Stunna and Patty Cake the worldwide Pusha (get this money)
Birdman nigga leave the guns in the busher
(cuff 'em up, let 'em up bitch)
Been shittin' up bricks unload 'em to Gucci
Boss of the ghetto with the round shape cookie
Shit one, Dro one nigga flood the block
If I don't go to jail niggas birds gone flop
Nigga sittin' on the toilet bitch get off the pot
The bird just landed so the hood gon' rot
New whips, big chips the Prada Gucci shit
But mami your fly Benz the wide skinny lips
She takes my flight she holds my weight
While the po-po staked out from state to state
It ain't nothin' to a baller baby
Pay the cars, big money, heavy weight, bird man, hood boss
Baby steppin on my line I'll show a little somethin'
They callin' you don't come out
Then the black crow will touch ya (touch ya)
[Chorus: x2]
Another soul lost
Had to make a shirt match my ox blood colored Porsche
The rims match of course
Blood hit his Timbs it reminded me of them
Glistenin' wrist on chiller
Gun in the same palm of gorgeous killer
I put this on my lord my niece was 4 when she felt chinchilla
I past the shore for that shit that made fiends rise from the dead like
Thriller
Gangster, hustler
At night still found time to kiss my mother
Live like I'm dreamin' kick my feet up
Gun pulled my waist remind me of my demon
So quite ya yappin' fore I get to clappin'
And have your body parts mix and matching fella
[Chorus: x2]
Aye, Aye, Aye, Aye, there it is nigga, there you have it
Birdman, Clipse you under-smelt, VA you know
Uptown nigga, we go anywhere with this bullshit
We flip bricks you under-smell (gangster motherfucker)
Aye nigga put this puzzle together
Aye Pharrell you did this year (you did it nigga)

Let's get this money (get the money)
Hey nigga I smell somethin', coke'll leave plastic bitch

Bought mami the matching shit and plucked her feathers

She was a raggedy bitch, switched her up, cleaned her life
You no longer a scrub you the Birdman's wife
So don't you think twice about this mink and leather shit

Drive anything you want cause you the Birdman's bitch
Get anything you need and you roll with the clique
Go to the club and get a front row seat
Pop mo Don P just shit on a bitch
See your fly now mami - used to be a dirty bitch
Got all these hoes trying to ride your dick
You maintain mami - you never just wild out
That's why Stunna put you in that big ass house

And never will I fall off
I work like I'm broke as hell,

Could quit if I wanna right now,
But I won't cos I love it, yes I love it.
You could never take my place
I'm here to stay 'cause my voice shakes
Ya speakers like bass does,
Coupe in the driveway,house and boat
??? in the stash, but I might look
Broke to the untrained eye, one may try
Hard to plead the case like son not fly,
Hoping that I fall off and don't come back,
But I married the game when I made one stack,
So you can get used to my face cos I ain't leaving
I ain't going nowhere tonight, stop breathin'
Even when I'm gone, and my songs on replay
Still like I'm here cos I live through the DJ
Cos this is the game I love, and I here to leave
A mark like a crayon does, it ain't never gon' stop
Thought he was gone but hes back and I'm with 'em

glaze-in-mt-eye,2005,ginuwine,Hip-Hop,"You saw me sittin' all alone, at the bar with my hat tipped low
Drinkin' a glass of gin with no ice
And even though I sipped it slow, it would burn like a volcano
That's when you came sat down and said hi
And you didn't even recognize who I was but I didn't mind,
Cause I didn't feel like signing autographs
You saw me as a normal guy and you treated me oh so nice
You just wanted to know why I looked sad
That's when I said
[Chorus]
I'm sad cause I hurt a soul tie
And when she left my soul died
Thought we'd be together for life
(thought we'd be together for life)
I lost her because of my damn pride,
I'm a man that can't cry, but look at me now,
With my face in the ground and a glaze in my eye.
I was so tough, til she called my bluff, packed up all her stuff
And left me here with a glaze in my eye.
My whole life I was taught, a man don't show his heart
But that's a foolish thought cause now I got a glaze in my eye.
And it's harder to hide, my runny nose and my throat is dry
But I'm still tryin' not to let it show
I'll just blame it on the alcohol, cause it makes me think I'm strong,
But that's some bull and we both know (we both know)
I can't believe I told some waitress, all of my personal business
And I ain't really believe you'd understand, but you did understand
You said everyone has issues, then you passed me a tissue
And told me that cryin' is what shows that I'm a real man
[Chorus]
I was so tough, til she called my bluff, packed up all her stuff
And left me here with a glaze in my eye.
My whole life I was taught, a man don't show his heart
But that's a foolish thought, cause now I got a glaze in my eye.
I was so tough, til she called my bluff, packed up all her stuff
And left me here with a glaze in my eye.
My whole life I was taught, a man don't show his heart

Your hair, your eyes, your sweet lips, and the way they taste
You got me going on a high that I have never felt
A beautiful thing (Not like the same thing)
This thing we've got it so amazing what I love the most
It's how we can talk and how we laugh and the fact we're so close
It's illusion but it's magic
No tricks involved
With you I got it all (With you I got it all)

I'm in love, I'm in love
Do you hear me?
Was so scared
Not prepared
But it just hit me
Glad it's us now I'm good
I'm so in love
I'm in love, I'm in love
And it's a good thing
Many miss out on things
Real lovers bring
Glad it's us now I'm good
I'm so in love
In my mind I'm in a world alone just you and I
You're my Eve and I'm your Adam so let's start new life
It's the way you make me feel like a new beginning girl
In all different ways (So many different ways)
You was still strong and had my back now the foundations laid
And I wanna spend the rest of my life just fulfilling you
With everything you want everything you need
[Chorus]
It's one of those things and
It's real hard to explain but
It's real and fills your heart
And hearts just don't lie no
You will know real love
Cause nothing feels like it and
It touches things inside
It's a real experience

Ain't try to play no games just wanna get with you

I can tell you really want to roll, would you be my baby
I know you feel it too, just by your attitude
Ain't try to play no games just wanna get with you
[Chorus]
So special, don't know what it is
But I know one thing that is for sure,
That since we met its been heaven
And when I saw your face,
Something inside of me told me you'd be the only girl for me
And you soon will be mine
She's like the spinners on them big themes
She's like the diamonds in my pinkie rings
And she's more like the love I got for when I sing,
Girl you are my everything, my everything
She's like the spinners on them big themes
She's like the diamonds in my pinky rings,
And she's more like the love I have for when I sing,
Girl you are my everything, my everything"

I will set you free
So take a chance on us
It could lead to love
Look ma
All I wanna do is be with you

chedda-brings,2003,ginuwine,Hip-Hop,"[Chorus]
I Was ready to change the game
You forfeited my love and still livin' the same
I felt like I was just wanted for the fame
It's a bit silly to think I would look again
'cause you have lost this nigga and a damn good friend
I thought you stick around but you couldn't stay
I was looking forward to those better things
I guess it's just the problems that the chedda brings
Just the problems that chedda brings
Thought I finally found my soul sista
Convinced I had it all, fell in love quicker
Been going through it all this time
And now I'm so sick of, your games
I'm so sick of your games
Girl, you're fuckin' with the wrong nigga
Must be out your mind or on some strong liquor
How could I stay with ya you right after neighborhood's been with ya I can't
You've already had your chance spending, all my Benjamin's
[Chorus]
She was a San Francisco gold digga
And she knew how to put a hole in a nigga pocket for the cold figgas
Chain you up and whip you take your Polaroid pictures
Oops, blackmail when she get annoyed with ya
Oh, she the type to do her thing
Type to lock you down, for half of the estate
From around the way
So fellas beware of the fuckin' game
She'll ruin your name and empty all the savings just the same
[Chorus]
[Jose]
Jose had this biddy testing her game
Usin' her black gold
That's what I guess she gets out my pockets
Chains like a lasso
It's past dough she's after my G's
Plus my reality
I max though payin her rent and now she mad at me
Is that so
Sayin' well Jose you bout to blow
Doin' songs wit Ginuwine, Sole, and little mo
I'm' like
What you talkin'
I don't know G and he don't know me
And you been talkin' sideways a little often
That's why when my thing softens
I start to loose interest
A gold digga with a fetish for riches
So bear witness
She the difference 'tween women and chickens skeazas and sistas
'cause the chedda brings change in the game
We talking figgas
[Chorus: x2]"
our-first-born,2003,ginuwine,Hip-Hop,"Now you made me the proudest Daddy,
Girl I'm at a loss for words,
Can't explain the feelings in me,
So proud when I heard,
That we were having a little baby,
Girl I couldn't wipe off my smile,
Heaven went and told the world,
That you were having my child,
Words can't explain it

Our first born,
It's our first little baby,
Come on, Our First born,
It's our first, It's our first,
Our first born,
It's our first little baby, see'mon
When you had it something went through me, and it hit my soul,
I had no control,
This little life was mine,
And I'll do anything to protect it,
I will never neglect it,
I will always stand right there,
I'm the Daddy, I'm the father,
Now what that means,
I will always love and care for you always,
Come on just say it again,
I'm the daddy, I'm the father,
I just can't explain how I feel about our first

A big cake, a bridesmaid, a best man
One day, we gon' have all that
[Ginuwine]
Girl I know we just met tonight
And this may seem like a lie
But, I'm not the player type
Guess what? Normally you wouldn't find me
Under the crowd of lights, in search of a love in life
But you shakin' that stuff right
I think I should make you my wife

You probably think I'm tryin' crush tonight
'cause I got a look of lust, like crust in my eye
No matter what I say, keep it tight
Keep it away from me like Superman and kryptonite

Givin' everybody turns, can I like a back burn
Oh, you got this lover want to beg to earn, oh baby
[Chorus: x2]

I know it sounds boo, I ain't even known you two
Days and I'm open to, the point that I propose to you
Must think I'm some kind of fool, don't you
You can call it what you're thinkin'
But I'm thinkin' we gon' jump that broom
[Method Man]
Back-seat of my jeep, let's swing an episode
Her neck and wrist all froze, I'm trynna catch a cold
Clippin' the trey, we sippin' away
On that 'Ze, innovations, slowin' slippin' away
Ain't life funny, don't nothin' move but that money
Oh boy, honeys, lookin' like Playboy bunnies
They whole swagger, that be the type that I go after
That get more attention 'cause they ass is more fatter
And every day gotta have a, but I ain't trynna make her unconfy
Or cramp her style like a monthly
How many women want a man, with big plans
Big feet and big hands, y'all understand
Why big daddy wear the big pants, I'm big boned
And if this symbolizes my life, I live long
My funny valentine, won't you be mine
Fifty grand on the wedding band, let it G-Wine

It's hard to let go cause it hurts
What if I am the one that you want and

The two-way. Ya heard?
It's a two-way street, it a two-way door
It's a two-way life (Pick it up and two way me)
It's a two-way sky it's a two-way tel
It's a two-way life, pick it up girl and hit me
Girl it's so easy, it ain't as hard as you trying
To make it seem
All you gotta do is pick it up, compose a
Message straight to me
I won't hear your voice but all you thoughts,
That's what I sure will see
Go to and push them key, and tell me
All of them freaky things
(Now you got some choices to make, you got them colorful girl one,
You got them black ones, platinum ones:well me?)
I prefer that platinum thing, to go with all my platinum chains
Plus it's hot to death I figure, plus I'm just
That platinum nigga
If it's dark light it up, put 'em up. Put 'em up
If it's closed, flip it up, in the club, beam me up
I got mine on vibe, so if you get me, I'll feel you
I'll call you back real quick, no lie better yet,
I'll just reply

I'll be within reach baby, I'll be right at your
Beck and call

So, if you not careful, you might get himmed up knawmean)
I recommend if you play the game, don't think
She won't do the same
If you a player know when to fold, the game is to be told, not to be sold
If it's dark light it up, put 'em up. Put 'em up
If it's closed, flip it up, in the club, beam me up
Now I got mine on loud, if you get at me I'll hear you
I reply back quick it's true, betta yet I'll just come to you"

Two reasons I cry
Cause my daddy's gone and my momma's gone
And I'm all alone, I'm so all alone
There are two reasons I cry
Cause my momma's gone and my daddy's gone
And my heart is torn, I'm so all alone
There are two reasons I cry
Cause my daddy's gone and my momma's gone
There are two
Daddy I miss you, it's hard to cope with my life
Didn't want to go on without you daddy (Still at night I cry)
I still can't understand why did you have to leave me
Why couldn't I just have seen all your pain, now I blame myself
I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy, cause when your parents
Are gone it's hard to believe
That is part of life, that you must go on
They would want you to still be strong
[Chorus]
Momma when you left, felt like my soul had gone
I still remember the day, had no words to say my heart was gone
(Still at night I cry)
You were the reason I lived, you gave me life that was pure
Always kept me so sure of everything, I miss you so
I looked down on you and no one ever knew I almost took my life
So I could be with you, I miss you so, one could never know
And I am lost and I'm feelin' so alone

Mean I'm out to cut

Mean I'll forget your name
Because I push a 6, doesn't mean I'll ego trip

You like a lady
Just Because
Hearing my name every other day,
People gonna say what they want to say
But they don't really know me babe,
Hate on me 'cause a brother paid
Only known you for a short time, things that you're
Hearing weighing on my mind
If you feel me, here's what I suggest, let
Me put your fears to rest

I quit it
But I' trying to, learn to be committed, to
You and only, I'm your man

I can understand why you're insecure, doing
All I can just to reassure
Seeing all these women at my stage door, screaming
'G' is the one that we're here for

Hard to believe
But they don't mean a thing to me, I am

I quit it
But I' trying to, learn to be committed, to
You and only, I'm your man

Couldn't much on it, see you kept it real
So you're gonna get rewarded, no doubt,

No time to wasting
I'll fulfill your every need

Girl its all to the good
You're by yourself I'm all alone
And we're both from the hood

That's probably why your by yourself now
But I caught your eye when you walked by
And you persist to try to entertain
All of them things that you probably just heard
None of its true and that's my word
Baby don't believe a thing you hear now
The haters are always on my back now
But you feel me and this I know
So won't you just let go
Tell me why

Can't blame you though if all your ex-boyfriends did you shady
But don't take that out on me girl
Oops I got to take it back its your world
Baby I'm just that guy ill show you why
If you just give me one try
I'm telling you I don't get down like that
Can't play the role
Or play myself
I just got to get in that's for sure
Got a little money
I spit game to the honeys
But you're all a nigga needs
I won't give you chicken feed

You should tell me something something
Can't imagine me just wanting
Put your cards out on the table

We can confess what we've been through
To one another to each other
There's nothing I'll keep from you
Why don't you reach and grab my hand
I'll be the one who understands
You can count on me
I won't do you wrong
I'll be here with open arms
You can count on me
I'll be here with open arms
The way that you were talking it's
Telling me that you're so hurt (so hurt)
You're insinuations are screaming to me
That you're really hurt (so hurt)
I want to be your mechanic and fix everything that's wrong
For you to be crying and feeling so down baby that's so wrong
It's too much to bare,
You seem so awfully scared
You need someone who feels you
You need someone who loves you
We'll need no more
We'll have each other and love will endure
No pain just love
With you that's all I see and I think of
And for you I'll give my right and left arm
I'll forever be a man I won't do you wrong
Forever love you
That's no question
You're the one girl
I'm confessing
Oh yes I will yes I will
I'll be here with open arms."
tribute-to-a-woman,2001,ginuwine,Hip-Hop,"You know baby
I know a lot of people are against you
All the ladies in the world
But you can do whatever you set your mind to do
Can't no one stop you
Believe that
It's time, now's the place, do your thing, it's your world
Don't be scared, its your world, don't trip, shout it out
You're the bomb, don't be scared, its your world
I can't begin to feel the agony I know you feel
I'm tryin' to break you out of that mold that once was real
But you're grown up and now it's time to let go all your fears
It's time for you to go,
Its time for you to live
You've been under your parents,
But they can't live for you
You got to go and do
What's best for you
Make your decisions and live by them and sweat and bleed
You must struggle to be you
Even when you're in need
It's time, now's the place, (now's the place) do your thing, it's your world
Don't be scared, its your world, don't trip, shout it out
You're the bomb, don't be scared, its your world
I know you expecting help but get out there on your own
Then you'll appreciate all that you have and all you own
And that no one out there can never ever take from you
Do you and all that's expected and you will break right through
This world
This crazy crazy world, (this crazy world)
This cold and harsh world, (this cold and harsh world)
This cruel and foul world
And now you're proud and all grown up and sure a woman now
Then you'll stand up
Looking ahead, feeling so proud

You can't be held down, (You can't be you can't be held down no you can't)
No one can stop you know

I know you get tired of the bull
(I know you get tired of the bull you wake up everyday and it seems
Like you can't go on all you gotta do is stick in there, everything will be ok)

How deep is your love girl let's get serious
How deep is your love girl I'm so curious
How deep is your love girl can I fall in it
How deep is your love girl can I get close to it
we've kicked it for a little while you know
I think it's time for us to start to move ahead
We both been patient and that's cool and all
But I'm in need of you and you don't seem to even care
we've been in slow mo
Never swung an episode
So what's man to do
Stay or go cheat on you
Tell me baby what are you so scared of
I'll be real gentle when I'm making love to you
[Chorus]
There ain't a thing you can't get from me
Whether it's ice, money come what may
I did everything you asked of me
But you must simply do not feel the same way
How longer do you need
can't you easily see that I'm the one for you
Tell me what I should do
Whoever hurt you made it rough for me
But you are you, I am me, he was he
[Chorus]
This love can't go unspoken
You got me wishing, hoping
You must let your judge lout
we've been through it all before now
This time we make that move now
Somewhere, somewhere, and somehow
Let's not play, not yo games
don't live, die ' don't live die
We're too grown

role-play,2001,ginuwine,Hip-Hop,"[Chorus]
Let's play a little game, a forte
Here's a little fantasy and role play
No lips ever the same, so let's play
A little fantasy and role play
Come right in and take off your skirt
Sit right down and let G go to work
'Cause being my patient has it perks
Come and show the doctor exactly where it hurts
You say the pain, it hurts right there
So come and lay it down, yeah, right over here
You see with me, the fun will never end
Playing my little game of role play pretend
[Chorus]
Come right in, with the handcuffs on
I planned a lot of kinky stuff to the break of dawn, yeah
We're gonna do it nice and rough 'til your fears are gone
I'm a be the one to flip it up and rub it down
And that's my word, it's bond, yeah
'Cause I'm your master and your my slave
Everything I say you will obey, yeah
You see with me, the fun will never end
Playing my little game of role play pretend
[Chorus]
Now I can be your cowboy, ride in my rodeo
I can be your dancer baby, see my exotic show
I can be your teacher, and you can be my pet
Or I can be your director baby, get naked on a movie set
Whatever your fantasy, whatever your dream
Just set the stage girl and let's start the scene
Tonight's the night I'm gonna give into you, yea
The way you wish those other guys would do

that-s-how-i-get-down,2001,ginuwine,Hip-Hop,"[Chorus]
Sittin' in my five double-o on twenties
Sittin' low-low
That's how I get down
(Get down, get down)
If you want some of this
Baby girl all you gotta do is say so
That's how I get down
(Get down, get down)
Put you in a crib, ice you out
Buy you whips at your disposal
That's how I get down
(Get down, get down)
I'll give you everything you've wanted
All you gotta do is let me know
That's how I get down
(Get down, get down)
Every day I see you baby
You're standing alone
Do you have a man and are you going home?
He should be picking you up
Not have you take the bus
If that's how he gets down
You need to leave the ground
'Cause he doesn't care for you
He doesn't live for you
He doesn't want for you
Nor is he down for you
You can have the world baby, just want to let you know
Come get with a man, and let the boy go
[Chorus]
You'll never want for nothing
You'll never take a fall
You'll have just what you want
Prada, Gucci, and all
I'm offering everything to you
Things are what they seem
This is not a hoax
And no this ain't a dream baby
You need affection baby
You need protection baby
You need the love that I know you ain't been gettin' baby
Take a hold of my hand
Let me lead you there
You need to be free
You shouldn't have a care
[Chorus]
Now either you want some rocks or a hard place
You lookin' for daddy but searchin' all in the wrong place
Tell him this ain't no dog race or cat fight
Just pull it together and get his act right
Mack right, while I'm bendin' curves in his 'Lac right
What was he thinkin' in thinkin'
He must be out his mind
Gotta be prankin' and stankin'
Crooked and out of life
I'll take you shoppin' and knockin'
Rockin' the proper fit
These women jockin'
And me I talkin' the Prada shit
You pour some Ginuwine, I'll pour some Night Train
I'ma turn these lights out
We can do our night thing
He got a V4 and I got a [Repeat: x5]
He got his ex-girl, I'm about to X by
So if you with it, admit it
And let me hit it, hit it
Until you feel it
'Cause I don't stop, get it, get it
You need a new coach
Let's start a new game
You on the right track, but you on the wrong train

Why did you take your love from me

Why did you take your love away
Why did you go, why did you leave,
Why did you take your love from me
Something I said, something I've done,
Why did you take your love away
I've been single, been lonely, and hating every second of it baby
I can't sleep right, one mo' night, cause I miss the lovin' from my lady
I would give up almost anything to get you back into my life
Baby I'm sorry for whatever I've done and I want you to be my wife
[Chorus]
What's the problem, can we talk baby, I thought our love was real and true
You can tell me, I'm all ears girl, There's nothing we can't get through
Whatever the problem is we'll work it out, don't break up a happy home
Life is nothing without love to share and I don't want to be alone
[Chorus]
The memories are too much to bear
I'm so in love with you and I'm about to lose my mind
Don't know what I've done to make you leave me you baby
But I'll be true to you if you come back to me
You, you, you, you

Gimme an ounce for 350, nigga need a quick divorce/ My niggas keep tellin' me what they keep sayin' about B in the Source/ But I don't read magazines, nigga that's just irratation/ Bizzy reads the type of books to further along his education/ Little do they know about what-what-what/ Little do they know about who-who-who/ Little do they know about me-me-me/ Get these and tell about you-you-you/ Ain't no time to be trippin' on women cause women will have you get caught up and shot/ Lil' niggas them bitches is yours so slap on tha rubber or beat up the cock/ Lil' niggas ya'll so horny/ Only got yo' car for broads/ How could I be hatin' when ya'll are the fakest niggas I've ever saw/ Ya'll rollin' with snitches, I don't know no snitches/ I roll with real niggas till they fall off, God pick 'em up for they loose they britches/ And I feel my children love me, Daddy gotsta do mo' better/ By the time we makin' money and spendin' my time with 'em, with 'em, with 'em, stuck up in the middle/ Play me like fiddle, filthy like everyday, don't be fickle motherfuckers

Would it be better if we could just choose the future, blood mixed up, call me fuchsia/ Thug picked up by the people; No Ruthless, no medusa/ See I got jacked in Beverly Hills, still I keeps it real, very selective, wanna just smoke and chill/ See I'm a veteran, all the grenade launchers wont cost me much/ Anyone could get extorts/ Yeah nigga, you can be touched/ I did all my dirt in the 'burbs/ I was ridin' around with my sisters' babies father/ Double barrel shot-gun say word/ Ready or not here come my words, steady or not, that shit's absurd/ Already got, me all perturbed/ Cop on tha block, gettin' on my nerves/ This is the lifestyle of that brick sellin' been falsified/ Niggas don't let 'em lie to yall, I'm a tell the truth on mine/ And I really want no more/ Catch yo' ass security wires/ Open the door, these rappers is scared as hell/ What you frontin' for? He got his entourage, and he got his bag of weed, is this the way it is? Little Bizzy takes the lead

I don't have to respect it and you don't have to respect it/ Gimmie my space, and I'm a give you yours/ It's my profession, nigga (Nigga!)

Twenty Two years and still countin' clockin' collatoral, baffled while we really here up against obsticles/ I'm a radical, killer Capo-Confuscious, throw up my fist if we compatible/ No love? Fuck it, then let's battle/ Ammo explode, machine gun rattle/ Everybody scatter, hysterical/ Sirens, police patrol (Whoa!) But they keep on rollin' soon as they see that this O.G. to back controllin' the streets/ Probablly some real niggas, got me heated, state your beef/ These bitches need to practice what they preach, capice? Rest in peace Martin Luther King, who truly was a bigger man than me, turned the other cheek/ Nigga, please! Generation X is more than the weak, just a little sneak peek preview of what I came to do/ Simply dominate, won't tolerate, dispute/ Nickel plated, aim to shoot 'em up/ Suggest you pussy's keep your lip shut or get fucked

United we stand, divided we fall for the same bullshit like snipers on Whitehouse lawns/ In the same 'hood shit, got niggas from Compton to Africa on that thug shit/ Reginold Deny, any comment I lost my blood reppin' Karlos Davis/ I can't love shit unless the fullest extent is given/ I'm above this deception, I know they intentions/ Weapons of thug shit if ever they step out of line/ From ashes to dust, bitch! Ride, never been far from the grave, since the murder, never been afraid/ My cradle had a guage close by when my Father was stressed/ Momma asked him to leave as she departed to death/ And ever since, I've been convinced that it's kill or be killed/ Had the young mind of a scholar, but society failed/ Josiah Ben Rasu, they caged my brother back in '96 but now in Armageddon we ridin' forever

-Bizzy Bone (Hollis Jae)-Chorus-
Where would I be without my niggas? I love my niggas/ I could do it all alone, but you're mine/ I would never bite my niggas or hide my niggas, just continue writin' my niggas, you're all my life/ My niggas, I love my niggas/ I could do it all alone, but you're mine/ I would never bite my niggas or hide my niggas, just continue writin' my niggas, you're all my life
-Bizzy Bone-
Now let the breeze blow, sunroof, roll in the whip/ Sippin' on somethin saucy, smokin' on somethin' so thick/ Reppin' the 7 to the fullest, give me bullets and clips/ Niggas is trippin' on me, actin' like The Kid is a bitch/ But when I needs my niggas, I hope they don't fall off/ This is as real as it gets, who want to see if he's soft? I've been guerilla stomped, turned into a killer from that/ I seen his family, damn glad that I had my strap/ Because I've been about it, and I don't talk about it/ Shot so many niggas in the 90's it's a blessing they ain't find me/ I can floss if I wanna nigga, fuck your bitch/ Half bitch and animal, back up off me (Rowl!) so I can dip/ Fuck courteous, do you think I'm stupid? Punk bitch, I understand you put it on Capo-Confuscious/ I don't give a fuck about no Ruthless, I never talk about Bone/ Get'cha thug on, pass the Hennessy and I'm gone
-Chorus-
-Bizzy Bone-
Shit, I'm a solo artists so I do solo shit, that's just the way it is/ You like the way that the money's drippin' up off the lips, word hustla worldwide/ All the way to Cali, clear to the otherside/ Daddy's up and down, right/ Bizzy The Kid, remember that I used to hide from the Fed's with Hope and Heather/ We was kidnapped so they gave us therapy/ I used to play Mouse Trap as the psychiatrist, he stares at me/ Ya'll new millenium, and yes, I'm old school all religion, that shit you need when we was all locked up in prison/ It's like forgettin' Pac, everyone forgot Yak, and plus my nigga, T Rock, T Rock/ I've been in Los Scandalous in the tree tops/ Nigga blowin' blood at the cherry-lime six-four drop/ Side to side with the lean and the doors all locked/ That's how we ride when another place is gunned on block, you'd better believe it
-Chorus-
-Bizzy Bone-
You better believe it ain't no fairy tale/ Don't nobody pay my motherfuckin' bail, I'm goin' to jail/ With a stomach full of Hennessy, exstacy pills, and I'm a do it once/ You only live once, for real/ Fuck it, snort the cocaine, give me a drink right out the bottle/ If you give me a germ, it ain't nothin' my girl can't swallow/ Is it the first of tha month? Is this tha crossroads? You niggas is lost souls, I am the arrow stuck in the crossbow/ Suffered too many things, I did it all on my own/ Liquor was only loyal, but niggas was always gone/ Don't give me no shyste shit, don't need me no feisty bitch/ Niggas is feelin' froggish, I'll murder you with the quietness (...murder you with the quietness)
-Chorus-"
i-understand,2004,bizzy-bone,Hip-Hop,"Shit- heh, friends- heh
A friends come and go I done learned that shit
Either through death or money issues
Or you know what I mean just time and space
Family sometimes you the biggest enemies man
Heh shit
Those that love me if you leave me
I understand, made some bad decisions in my life
I understand, raise my right hand up to God
Right where I stand
I'm a go get strong, return a better man
You better believe it you see me
How we creeped up out of Cleveland get your money baby
If not I'm gonna break even I won't let you play me
Your game ain't even season
It's that thuggish ruggish Bone I hope you know
Little be	the reason see you creepin baby
But what are you really seekin
Are you weak, don't believe in me, believe in Jesus
I'm a freak, but baby that's for life
And all the weak I'm goin deep, and I can roll deeper than you
Half breed rock the mics to survive
And I might not make it out alive I'm spittin to save my life
Tryin a make it right welcome to the world that we live
And all that I did was crawl up out the stuff for my kids
So rest in peace to Little Eazy
But your paper work was sleazy and the black widow was horny
Baby was gettin greedy my boys is 'posed to be watching my back
Load up the guns and let's attack
But ain't nobody tryin to feel me with stack
For my baby's
Those that love me if you leave me
I understand, made some bad decisions in my life
I understand, raise my right hand up to God
Right where I stand
I'm a go get strong, return a better man
Those that love me if you leave me

I understand, raise my right hand up to God
Right where I stand
I've returned, I've returned
Better bring my money baby nobody is gonna stop me
I'll fill 'em up with that hot shit
Bullets all in your body better watch me wicked posse
Yeah, automatic shotguns half of these rappers talkin
Ain't none of 'em ever popped one
Little kid from South View who would've thought that I'd make it
And the people ain't behind me my family's kinda freakish
That thuggish ruggish, nigga from Columbus
And this is the way we play spread your rumors
I just love it do it all day everyday
Ride to the rythme of the nickel put the pen in the pack now
And I know you fear me, I done been there
Done that, run that, fun that covered around
And let me kill 'em with the venom we killin 'em with the sound
Every city, every little bitty town
Everybody want to break me down
Nobody gonna take me down East 99 has been abandoned
Cleveland they show me love, they still wonderin how
I made it up outta the famine better believe it baby, baby
Should a listened to my people, still runnin from demons and evil
War
Those that love me if you leave me
I understand, made some bad decisions in my life
I understand, raise my right hand up to God

I'm a go get strong, return a better man
Those that love me if you leave me
I understand, made some bad decisions in my life
I understand, raise my right hand up to God
Right where I stand
I've returned, I've returned
I'm sick of the drama, sick of havin beef with my momma
And beef with my sisters my brother got murdered
Over marijuana bless the bewilders
Strugglin, hustlin all of my life, watching my back
They already tried to murder me twice
I smoke the herb that I like, I never done coke in my life
We buy but I lie if I did it I'd tell entertainment tonight
Ain't no slackin in my rack it ain't no shame in the game
It ain't no slippin and the pimpin ain't no crack on the brain
You gotta be jealous of me and my fellas
Ain't that what they tell us sell us anything
We helpless give me a little bit faq and help us
We strugglin, jugglin, thugglin, hustlin, thuggin up in the club
No one to talk to, you step on his shoes
You really fucked up, poppa you was a roller
But his pockets are all swollen, you met the dope man
And now we on the block ask who told 'em
Sell 'em some soap man that's for all the times you played me
Old man this is your son with a blunt and a gun
Check out my slow jam
Those that love me if you leave me
I understand, made some bad decisions in my life
I understand, raise my right hand up to God
Right where I stand
I'm a go get strong, return a better man
Those that love me if you leave me
I understand, made some bad decisions in my life
I understand, raise my right hand up to God

Sip that crown all day everyday
Hey, hey and then I'll be pay-e-yayd
Fresh out of them carcus mountains

You gotta love me cuase I'm ghetto fabulous
What do you think, half breed rock the mic
Seven don't rock no pig I'm giving the people what they like
I've heard of murder but I don't know nothing
Like 'ternal clink, sink
I ain't had a drink in four motherfuckin weeks
I'm gonna go split my dome, what do you think
You better believe it

I'm not afraid to die
And I'm not afraid to fight, and we can

Puerto Ricans call me papi cholo stop drop
Pop in the blunt black mafioso
Bullets be rellellen through you fucks
Gotta a cop coppin a co-co
The block is hotter than lava
My nigga dial it this is devotion, holla
One of thee broke heart rapper
Your hatred is gasoline my words are vitamin mena
You need to shut your mouth and mind your manners
Gettin high since I was nine
Dead homies, I could still smell pine
And wether I twist my tongue or not
Little Bizzy still gonna shine
So re-lax your mind and let your conscience be free
And get down to murderous music from me
Check out my new thang please
Don't let 'em rap they whack
Don't know how to move thangs, pack
Or playin in stadiums, third markets
I threw thangs back
And I'm the rebel that made it rappin 'bout crack
Read many books to elevate my levels
So the words would match I am the fresh batch
Bakery, seasons veteran kesh
Now let me ride, gotta thank God just for saving a wretch
So y'all come on
[Chorus]
I'm not afraid to die
And I'm not afraid to fight, and we can
Bang, bang all day (all day), all night (all night)

And I'm not afraid to die, and I'm not afraid to fight
So we can bang, bang all day (all day)
All night (all night, all night) and this is how we ride
This is how we ride, (this is how we ride)

Bizzy ain't never made no honor roll
Dope dealin and dropped out
Got addicted to money can't stop it
This is what it's all about
Drunk, yellin ""Geronimo"" here foo
Seven is jumpin with me black limo window tinted
Roll it down let 'em smell that sticky
This Bizzy the Kid let the prescense come
Graze your city I refuse to go back to funerals
Niggaz be dying to quickly
Cause the knuckle heads get buckled
I know they comin to get me in my life
Like I'm blackula only the lights been with me
Here we go into the king elected by the people
I gotta grip on things I'm watching evil
You know my steez plus believe that I'm gone with it
From dusk to dawn you could ask the matradi
Bizzy got that Filet Mignon
I don't need no empathy play the track
As I control the symphony
Gotta get my monopoly property of that nigga Bizzy
Thought he was hard and got his jaw brought
Bitch I can pass out, get up, start rappin and have it all locked
[Chorus]
I'm not afraid to die
And I'm not afraid to fight, and we can
Bang, bang all day (all day), all night (all night)

This was written for you?
You want me to say this?
Yes, I want you to say this
Stay out of the wonderland baby

Rebuke murder for me; lust, wrath and sloth
Greed, gluttony, envy and the pride of the thought
I'ma tell you smite that servant, kamikaze no curtains
Slice through the smoke of the mirrors, imperfect
Impervious to danger, fear God, the beginning of wisdom
Enter to the kingdom, would you listen?
I miss you most definitely, spit knowledge, smell my breath
Righteous watchin the way, memory step, whoa!
Pay attention to the street signs
I ain't leave yet; never will, love all
Heavenly Father in the name of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ y'all
Stick with the fight y'all
Spiritual physical shit, c'mon fade that
Feel me though

No they don't hear me though, shake y'all
How could I fake y'all? Never break y'all
Misfit maneuverin, tryin to take y'all
Plead, excuse me?
They don't hear me though, shake y'all
How could I break y'all?
How could I take y'all, misuse, fake y'all?
Split serious please, they don't even know me!
Flash in the flask
They don't even know me
It coulda been flash in the flask
They don't even know me young homie

It coulda been the flash in the flask in the dash and the cash
And the mask of different madman, flip blast
In the glass of vision, precision to, get past on the map
Very bad vocal from every paragraph
Blast about bad ass, booty and task
Rat-a-tat-tat-tat, mash on wicked minded and smash
What's nasty? Who the fuck ya talkin ta?
Take off my shirt, quickly tell 'em harkin up
Save last days c'mon, show 'em what we workin with
We praise God, Jesus Christ, most certainly
Baby, baby, world so crazy
Kinda hazy on them sucka, very wary time when I say

Man, they don't hear me though shake y'all, break y'all
How could I fake y'all, take y'all
Maneuver, try to take y'all

They don't hear me though, shake y'all
How could I fake y'all, break y'all, take y'all
Please! They don't know me!
... For the, rest of my life
They don't know me
For the rest of my life, my soul
They don't know me
[Bizzy Bone]
For the, rest of my life the soul and spirit are priceless
I'd rather be iceless than to get played twice
Give 'em tussin homeboys in red, throwin up thrices
Peek deep inside the 4-4, and you can see rice
Like it or not, find it or not, I'm feelin Tyson
Fuck that sick round, missionary shit now
Licensed to pulverize, premise is capital
And the capo go fast in the battle
As they rattle an awful judgment, who the fuck you judgin?
Little grudges is so sledged in the murder while we walk in the dirt
Tryin to cure my little spirit, turn me over my lil' soldier
And they lookin at me tryin to keep me hurt
Feelin the pain huh, gain huh, plain huh
Throw up the one, stay the same huh
Rain come harder, call us homies huh
Footprints, mop, dust, turn the pallet
Power come quick fast, watch yo' ass
Hand on the hourglass, power be the God
Guess that, press that, full court with a fine ass wall
The sin it be the biggest, let's get spiritual
We're off into the light, when it's our gaaaaame
We flip pages, how we rock the ages, the kid is so amazin
But they don't feel me though
They don't hear me though, shake y'all
[Chorus/Outro]
They don't hear me though, shake y'all
How could I break y'all, take y'all, fake y'all
Maneuver man... I say they don't know me
They don't hear me though, shake y'all
Fake y'all, break y'all
How could I maneuver and then take y'all
They don't know me, they don't know me
They don't know me, they don't know me
Evidently they don't know me
How could I fake y'all, shake y'all, break y'all?
They don't know me... heheh"

Representing the one forever and ever and ever
We come to you from another dream
From another time, another station (it is only one true God)
Praise God in the name of the father, the son and the holy spirit
(Could you tell meeeee)
[Chorus: Bizzy Bone]
Could you tell me what you see, you see, you see, you see
I can read yo' mind baby (I can read your mind) I can read your miiiiind
Hahaha; could you tell me where we'll be, we'll be, we'll be, we'll be
I can read yo' mind baby (I can read your mind)
I can read your, and I can read your mind (I can read your miiiiind)

Most immaculate, elegant, pick up a piece of paper
Put ya Pamper on; scamper run, militant get ya Panther on
The crooked of tryin to pull a caper, cause they wanted a vision
Now it's honey-coated for the dumb shit; evil don't run shit
Wanna see the picture for flesh and desire sentencing
The essence to the fire and purge, deeper inside ya
Reaper be right behind ya, keep it movin be blessed
It's the test, only the best, beautiful love, yes!
Can't believe they wanna hold a brother back like this
God provide, ride through the pine without a dime
Baby think it's a crime, and she always get pissed
Get ya ego out the way, baby listen to this
I got a problem with racism, placism, hatorism
Gatorism, prejudice, demons all in the way
They don't even ask you for identification, what did he say?
Get ya money little homie, they'll never know you're okay
[Chorus]
[Bizzy Bone]
Listenin to bullshit, knockin on wood
Praise God don't get it misunderstood
While I was rollin through the hood
Boulevardio, you should (Let Me Love You)
like you was listenin to Mario, it seems that I can't budge you
But those crooked thoughts they don't harm me though, shake that, shake that
Money-maker tryin to get the paper blamin poppa for everything
Somebody tell me who put the food on the motherfuckin, table
Pumpin up because the fuckin humans actin able
Lamb, cram to understand plan, baby boy like Clark Gable
Gone with the wind, with a full confession like Conseco
Now all of the rest of the baseball players step up
Glory be the god of the name of our lord and savior - Jesus Christ
Ain't no weapon formed against us will prosper
Send the streets they needed medicine, and God'll send a doctor
Gon' break 'em off real proper
Even though they really don't want you to prosper
So now you judge me, and only God love me - ahh!
[Chorus]
[Bizzy Bone]
It ain't a question or a notion, commotion it'll just happen
Words written but we freestyle rappin
Keepin it movin and we groovin in the spirit for show
Bringin the light into a halt, and we caught, and it stop like whoa
Don't turn around, no rebirth in the salt, nigga let's roll
Baby don't turn around but she's persisted to go, mmm
Purified clean, write it in chalk, don't even talk
Let's concentrate on the mission little baby walk
Some say it's a weapon, the weapon of weapon of mass destruction
of body combustin trust if it come outside
See it's real in the battlefield, plenty fuckin battle scars
Switchin rides, switchin cars diggin E, peep the stars
Where we walk in the streets bad feet keep stallin
Bad wanna come me way, hey, he gon' keep talkin
And they wonder who, who's tellin 'em dodgin, God will provide the logic
Get the action in that you need through any ya problems, woo
Now if you accept it and you accepted just know that you're really respected
And the love that we have collected through the pressure of presence
See he's a present, and it's comin from my heart in its essence
These words we meshin together for further evidence of the lessons
Are you likin what you feelin? Nah, I think I feel it
Not to be Marvin Gaye, but baby you need some (Healing)
So we take it to the tabernacle then pass that feelin
Touch millions with the gifted that the father is willin
Look at ya people with some movement as we bond lookin improvin
That's the love you always enjoy to enlighten bein void
Gettin noid stay poised it's comin, don't you feel it?
You got it? I know you got it, you got it, I see you chillin
One love

See I was born in the womb, beatin down my mom's walls
Now in the 90's you can find 'em makin a chronic call
Definitely I need a blunt, come fill it up with some bud
East double 99 for life, ain't none of y'all fuckin with us
There I was with the Thugs, bustin and pullin out broke-ass guns
Tryna bluff my way, hey, I pistol-whip on shit
I'm still number one - runnin the click
and fuckin wit a, pump it on up in let the Regime get dumb
Buckin wit a 55 chance, Bizzy off in your city
Ready to dance with these itchy-ass, hands
And Bizzy on the off-ramp just cause I'm thuggin
Shit this music got me soft, tramps seein my cousins buggin
But I don't give a fuck, I'm puffin onions, the ounces and Bizzy smile
I made it and you hate it, that's the way the ball bounce
I keep my gun and make the money and that's for my baby son
What a creation in my life, I think he's a thug
And there I was, fuckin with the Thuggsta Lay'
with Flesh workin feedin the family in the C-L-E-V-E-L-A
Better believe indeed, I got somethin up under my sleeve
Connected to the thieves, when it gets thoughtless grow some weed
It's deja vu whenever I'm with you
I could smoke on forever, ain't it true that I do?
I can feel it inside, I can't explain how I feel
Remember when my neighbor Linda let a nigga eat a meal
Learn to fight off my back, on my own did he struggle
In the 'Land on my hustle tryin to piece on out the puzzle
Nobody knows when we'll die, it still maintain through the rough
I be the first to give my life, my life - BB da thug"

Surprise, it's really a bitch
I was raised by my papi though, papi though

In the strip club lookin for a humble young, thang
With a roll of cash money, motherfucker get it quick thug
Ha, fellas all around me don't sit too close to the door
And they gettin naked in this motherfucker, y'all keep calm
Got on time, they be rollin with dudes
Nothin but attitude, gotta give me latitude, heh
Bitches still mad that I don't fuck with a group
But I was raised by my poppa and my poppa told me trust no two
Straight verily, and in the spiritual form
And only God split so, and the spirit reborn
The baby still dancin, I see the bitches tryin to stop me
Never roll with a plan, can't copy gimme
They say that two is too sloppy
It tops and tear ya jalopy, can't even get monopoly
The soul game, and the baby boy he cocky
And you better watch your word game, cause the shit get stocky
My opportunity to ration out the love for the one, my papi
Muh'fuckers don't know what we do, no one got me
Only one true God in the house for sure
Who you roll with? I roll with the Lord
Trust and believe, lay low on these motherfuckers, break those jaws
And what you see is what the fuck they saw
We ain't fuckin with nobody who don't represent the father of all
And that's God y'all
[Chorus]
That, stick; when the faggots try to lust yo' body
Surprise, I said it really was a bitch
I was raised by my papi, and tell 'em they'll never win
Because they caught up in the sin and we drinks for free
Shake that stick, when the faggots try to lust yo' body
Surprise, it was really a bitch
And I was raised by my papi, can you tell 'em they'll never win
And they get caught up in the sin, round here we drink for free

She was playin on deception and spiritually was a dead-end
Mountin the battle station and we bring on no weapons
For the inception of the relationship
I guess I shoulda known...
She was playin for deception and spiritually she was dead
And mountin up the battle station, bring no weapons
The inceptions of the relationship, I guess I shoulda known
when she said she had us caught up on tape, bitch we ain't even bone
This warfare goes deep in the clones
Cheaper when they come up to park their shit, demons is on
Quick, Cleveland get gone, but I don't speak about the radius
A hardcore brother with the Father and the capius
The atheists, bitch-ass demons, they don't need no atheists
Fuck 'em, they should bust their ass
Cocksuckin break bitch, tell me where the tunes at
Iknowwhoyourollinwit - secrets tellin, they better lose that all
Baby we get it poppin down in the city streets
Either roll with the one or these bitches they gonna wreak
Don't sleep 'til the mission complete
I got a treat for the honey and man, honey is sweet

Yeah, shake yo' stick
And the faggots try to lust yo' body; surprise, really a bitch
I was raised by my papi, and I was raised by my papi
Yeah, that, stick
When the faggots try to lust yo' body
Surprise baby, it was only a bitch
And I was raised by my papi, tell 'em they'll never win
And they'll get caught up in the sin, round here we drink for free
Tell 'em again

And I'm damn sure that you don't want me
You better believe that time is tickin
I can hold no grudge, you can't haunt me
Callin up my player-ass partner while I'm sippin on wine
Only to soothe my little spirits, I think God can hear me cryin
When I wake up to the birds and then the herbs of the violins
But I think he rather have me disturbed, man I can't even sleep in silence

Much pressure in the stress game, less fame

Love thy neighbor, it's way beyond the fightin and the lightnin
Benjamin Franklin, with a 50 dollar bill I'ma fly the kite
And Robyn Givens, she's still tryin to play me like I'm Tyson
Oh poor baby, maybe I'm just a little bit sentimental
When it comes to the death I've wept, still weepin with whips
As my brothers they got hung by trees, and beat with whips
The pain is so deep that they carry so many regrets
Here's a message
[Chorus]
[Bizzy Bone]
With the world in a daze and the homies smokin haze
And they slangin on the Ave to upper classmen, hey
Slay, with the A to the K
Without a weapon watchin and listenin and, where without livin
Hey, get on the level as we smoke real fast
You take a puff and that's enough and throw it away in the trash
At last, minus the visual, where would I be?
You tell Eve to get her ass out the tree, that's cheap

Latch gate keeper
They couldn't even tie the laces on Jesus sneakers
Warrior with a speaker
Cause we are warriors, warriors, warriors

They tryin to reach ya with them old school tactics, make us strong
But when the karma comes back in other physical forms
Tell 'em man up, stand up, sit down, hands up
Hit that, smoke that, dope fingers, that slug bitch
So what if I strap with the warfare, everybody is here for the sightly change
People in physical war, only the Lord is keepin me sane
Above with the grain, in the go-go with the love
With the Lord you know we got him, in the name of our lord and savior Jesus
We never stoppin, tell 'em we never won't tumble but think what they did
They humble about love but love is here
we struggle up over the form for fears
We struggle up all the sin of queer, we live outta here, open the beer
Get to the finish the realish to get, realish to get, realish to get
Warriors

By the grace of God - tell 'em about the... out the show
Carry my baby, tell 'em I'm 'bout to come up out the show
Carry my baby, wherever you need to go
Carry my baby wherever my baby need to go
So we warriors comin to spit it without no princess
Plenty fuckin piano got your brain spittin senseless
We represent this, throw up your trigger finger now
And ain't no weapon formed against us, bitches love my style
But it'd be realer if you really love me
And I ain't never want a woman, just a woman love me

Grippin the bottle of gasoline and the alcohol was killin Dotty
Havin a ball, ball, but I'm still rollin through the shore

Hit 'em with blasphemy and they cashin in on his tragedy
You see I'm sorta like Dorothy but I'm a soldier
the wickedest witch in the West can't have me
Fuck the shoes look, barefoot, roll over Toto, there put
Put a stick in the mouth, and I might go as quiet as a mouse
Never did lie, ready and green, never so loud, quiet indeed
Remember the man be attend by the Ouija

Poppa makin honey, not money but the real bling
Bada-boom bada-bing, and let your freedom ring
Oh me, I'm mystical as ever all clerical, no little bits in the wind today
Cannibals pullin out a can of that bullshit
That bullshit, tell the bitches plan away
Scan away, literally been broke with a script
in the name of our lord and savior; Jesus Christ
In the name of the father and the son and the holy spirit all of it wise

One steppin up in the party for the {?}, patiently on a mission
I spread love, that's my family's tradition
Been on a mission as I'm lookin out for these enemies
Ain't no pretend-to-be's, dons of the game they playin centipede
Old school bring it close and serious now
Origin-al, with the mirac-al, to bow down
And tell the sixes that we comin to get 'em
unleashed by the disaster and you see these
little brothers thinkin they weathered the bible's evil-minded women
But the chicks never had me shook
They thought they had the good cookie
until they hooked up with the cookie crook
Whoa, give them a rose, and give you one for your jewels and such
So pay attention little playa cause this means so much

The only trick in war was workin out on my ego often
My flight is paid on the chicken hawkin
I don't work for evil so how the fuck they think I'ma mess with they people
They done read the book of demons, man what a slut
And then they only, heh - do your knowledge to the bitch, so what
And I'm about the kitten so what, and it won't even show up
I tell the wicked army that the father up in Heaven with us

For motherfuckers to know so there's no more indication
And it's no more battle station unless it comes from within
And this is the way we do it, pour out your cup on the sin
Fuck grindin and hustlin - and to keep the dudes
up off the stage while I'm shakin my stick, I've had enough of them
Ride past the enemy, smilin and laughin
I heard a bitch grabbed her homie, and I ride right past him
But, ha, pussy motherfucker have to bury me
Jesus Christ carry me, only God care for me
{?}, nobody comin woodward with animals
Sorta like Noah's Ark, the people here be like cannibals
I figured the war was so important that I give 'em the rules
But be sell out to bail out, in the moment of dues
The time is tickin, it's considered the doom
And the money that you possess as we possessed in the womb

Sleep in the streets, beggin for change, clutchin a cold bottle
Shit, niggaz fuck with death like it was thick bitch, with a fat ass
So you really ain't shit in the hood unless you got a {?} and you got cash
Don't you think you need to get this shit
cause niggaz in the hood respect the troop
I state it together and get the proof

About love we shared can't compare to nothing babe
Repeat 1 till end"
no-regrets,2001,case,Hip-Hop,"Loving you was incredible
It came so natural to me
Cause you were always available
For every one of my wants and needs
We always talked about settling down
Raising a family
But sometimes in life our plans ain't meant to be, ooh yeah
Baby I've tried
But couldn't say
What I really did want from you
Baby and now
My life, my life hasn't been the same
No, no, no babe
Can we give it a chance
Can we start all over again
Before we throw it all away, I just need to know
Here I go around again
Just won't let it die
Being wrong or being right
I just have to try
Love leads me right back to you
It never tells me why
I ain't gonna go through life
With no regrets
Now we can start by makin' apologies
But saying sorry ain't gonna make it right
All the spiteful things you done said to me
Cause I heard you a million times
But now I've learned how to express
What's really on my mind
So I'm telling you
I need you in my life
Baby I've tried
But couldn't say
What I really did want from you
My life, my life hasn't been the same
Can we give it a chance
Can we please give it one chance
Before we throw it all away, I just need to know for sure
Baby now it's up to you
Cause livin' life without you
Just ain't cool
So darlin' I want you back
Cause I'm a man with no regrets"

I'm sick & I'm tired of niggas asking bout mine
If I'm cockin that iron, I'm telling you I'm sending them signs
I move fast forward I ain't got no button to rewind
I react of instinct I ain't stressin no time
I came a long way from peddlin rocks
Block recognized the gansta & he up my stock
Showed me the recipe & other grams I copped
Home ain't a home withoutta arm & hammer box
Shit, Jeezy just be being on that cell
Got them pre-teen numbers I like, like R.Kelly (I got that work nigga)
Lotta niggas they be claimin the spot
But we the only ones that still represent it like mascots
So ask not why my attitude is shitty
Step aside why a real nigga move the city, huh
From my block to your block niggas know me
They know that ole reppin ass niggas a O.G.
We use to rock flip-flops, tube socks with gold teeth
& A flip flop crease with gold shoes on all they feet
Please believe we ain't playing no games
But I will take a charge if you try to drive my lane
Plus I gotta donkey dick to drive the broads in sane

Now here I go on the patio with a flat head screwdriver
Prying on the side door in a gat proof suit liner

Wanna eat, fuck wit me
You don't want to see me pissed off, yeah
Fuck until my dicks off, Boyz N Da Hood
Nigga, this is riff ruff
Now I rock a lot of ice 'cuz I'm keepin' it slum
Six lugs at the bottom, lockin', keep 'em in tone
Crack rock cocaine, what we keep where I'm from
You don't believe me, nigga, come and see where I'm from
Keep 2 or 3 heaters dug deep in my bum
The police tryin' to keep the concrete on my palm
But I got shit to do
And I got bricks to move, okay
But y'all are playin' for 4 mil
You can get for 2 nigga and try to play me dude
And I'm gone put yo ass in some baby shoes
And I don't mean the ones that your babies use
I know I talk about my niggas a lot
But I shoot too
Give me something to nut up about
And watch me shoot you

Keep a plastic tone, y'all want it bring it on
We'll creep up in yo home, hangin' by yo bitches thongs
Say you's a gorilla, say what happened to King Kong
We real play makers and this is not ESPN
Welcome to the gutter, now watch the shit fest begin
Ain't no fuckin' Jack Triple but I'm bakin' cakes
Plus my cakes triple, what that fag makes
Fuckin' just to stay awake, makin' sure I never stumble
Granted till my bank statement look like social security numbers
Call us cookie monsters, makin' cookie niggas crumble
Catch a double digit jersey number if you fumble
I'm gone tote the poll lock and load
Shoot till you hear that bow
Take my time, speak my mind like I'm [Incomprehensible]
Got a country slang, baby, you can tell, ain't it
You can kill too, a lot of us got them feds at us
Still keep a stankin' kitchen
'Cuz in the midst of the caine
On the way, the crack smell durin' the intermission
Triple beam hand held hanksty
Got some caine stain colored on the finger nail
Chrome black dished back up til I [Incomprehensible]
Saw him walk a thin line but it's not a fat red
I'm gone rap for these packed heads
Gats crack, sells sex and blacks that want to stack mils
Smokin' on the purple stack
Runnin' in yo house ramblin' wondering where the work is at
Hoes in the third, still hollerin' where the purses at
Phone in Atlanta, ring the family where they murked at
6:45 am, life's great, got the bacon soda
I'm cookin' pancakes, that's right
Where I'm from nigga, I'm the man
Take him out, break him down like a lap dance
I ain't playin', I got hella choppers
Call my partnas then they got helicopters, that's right
Just like my old job but a lil' different, what
I used to work at churches chicken
But now I cook my chicken to my own kitchen
A kitchen fork and a glass pocket
Try to rob if you want get ya ass shot

I'm from the city where they they tote glocks, chop rocks
Ride spinnin' wheels and they'll steal ya car and send it to the chop-shop
50 slabs in my socks, couple grams in my drawers
We ain't even in the club and everybody tipsy dog
Down South dope dealing, ride high smoke phillies
We come watch how I, ride by and smoke niggaz
Call me Mr. Toucan man, I bought a new tan band
With two K's in the palm of my hand, to show we ain't playin'
Where you stand is where you land, sprayin' with either hand
Wings expand like eagles but land like Peter Pan
Pull off in the Regal man, rollin' that reefer
Holdin' a lethal, felony piece in my pants
And when I see them people I'm mashing the gas in the jag
Stashin' the mask with the cash bumping that Beanie Sigel
And when you see my my pants matching my brand
Brand matching the band and the band matching the Benz homie
And when I'm creepin', I'm sneakin' a bitch from France
I'm freakin' her she so freaky she sleeps in the 3-point stance

And I'll kill all of y'all
Make ya bald head like a bowling ball
I tried to tell him he ain't understand
So I sprayed his whole crib like the Orkin' man
I'm bout this money and this damn powder
Leave your hood ground zero like the twin towers
Y'all put his ass in a pine box
Black suit black top with the matching socks
For playin' with my damn cake
I'll have your ass laying still like some dead weight
On the grind for these mega chips
Flippin' fake lays and I ain't talkin' 'tato chips
If you ain't real then you'd better chill
If he ain't got my damn money I'm a Kill Bill

Livin' a nightmare, go halkin' with Stephen King
You work with a butcher knife, be lookin' like Wolverine
I run with my dead folks, my life is stuck in between
I'm one with the holly ghost, we say no 'bout twice a week
You a killa, well gone and kill, you a gangsta, well join a gang
You a pimp, well then pimp a bitch, get 'em rich or just get the change
See I live by the quarter mile, I'm walkin' against the grain

Niggaz they pull drastic acts, twenty stacks will get ya whacked

Hit ya with the button, leave ya drowsy like some Benadryl
Casting gears been in the field, Ola bear share many tears
Saw her baby boy get killed, sho baby boy hella trill
Keep it G for all to see, but all don't keep it G like me

Ay, close ya eyes, let me take ya there
Got a prison sentence tucked off in my underwear
62 grams nigga, servin' straight deuces
Young nigga riding Magnum, squattin' dub deuces
Mind on my money, money on my mind
Snitch call me up, exit's on the line
For the love of these exotic cars
We'll risk it all, even time behind bars
My reality is yo nightmare
And this is my life, it's no nightmare
I ain't slept in two weeks, shit I'm paranoid
They snatched my patna up, the alphabet board
No talkin', no fussin', no flossin', we shootin' to kill

confrontation,2005,damian-jr-gong-marley,Hip-Hop,"Mr. president, distinguished delegates,
Since the beginning of modern civilization
Generations have witnessed and inherited the only conflicts of world wars
But behold the marriage supper of the lamb and the bridegroom onto his bride
Then shall the earth's children know the true expression of one love
Then mother earth shall honeymoon in peace.
Forever eliminating the aspirations, lust and anguish of wars and rumors of wars, Selah!
See it deh know the innocent going up in vapors
And propaganda spreading inna the Sunday papers
not even superman coulda save you with him cape cause
Red-a judgement a blaze, blaze ya
And Babylon a gamble the youth dem life like racehorse
And gi dem a uniform and a shave dem head with razors
And now the clock a strike war, don't be amazed 'cause
Inna dem churches tryin' to save, saviors
Can we do it? we can do it, we shall do it!
Boom! Tell dem fe uh draw mi out when the world government inna falling out
Only few men survive crawling out
Run left him colleagues dem sprawling out, nearly dead!
Medic haffi haul him out
And give him two tranquilizer fi stall him out, deh pon base!
Can't get no calling out when him hear from the shout last week
Him mistress find a new shoes
Wife can't get no news and lately she starting to doubt, she still searching!
And the youth dem bawling out
Working hard not to let it all come out
Well it's not safe to go walk about
A slaughterhouse from Baghdad to water house
She start to arouse sometime she want a spouse
She start go out, start beat a darker stout, guns come out!
Working people funds run out
Keep a show last week and no one come out, bombs come out!
Mi gas tank just run out, bombo clatt!
The scotch tape just run out, weed run out!
Yuh senses must dumb out, mi have a pound round a back deh a gwan sun out
Nah come out! 'Til the chalice bun out,
Nah come out! 'Til the malice bun out, a war!
Zimbabwe to berlin wall
Blazin' like a burnin' ball, loose ball, dat no work, in war
Sleeping, dat no work..in war
Can't wear jheri curl, in war
No diamond and pearl, in war
Can't drink weh a serve, in bar
Gas wi fuck up yuh nerves, in war
Shot wi blood up yuh shirt, in war
Can't go lift up no skirt, in war
Now disease and germs, in war
Can't go release your sperms, in war
Stamina must preserve, in war
Fire constantly burn, in war
Red, it red, it red, it red, it red!
If you cannot do it, if you are not prepared to do it, then you will die.
You race of cowards, you race of imbeciles, you race of good for nothings
If you cannot do what other men have done
What other nations have done, what other races have done
Then you yourself shall die.
See it deh know the innocent going up in vapors
And propaganda spreading inna the Sunday papers
not even superman coulda save you with him cape cause
Red-a judgement a blaze, blaze ya
And Babylon a gamble the youth dem life like racehorse
And gi dem a uniform and a shave dem head with razors
And now the clock a strike war, don't be amazed 'cause
Inna dem churches tryin' to save, saviors
Hey, now wi fore parents sacrifice enough
Dem blood sweat and tears run like syrup
Any day a revolution might erupt, and the sky's over Kingston lighting up
For the new generation rising up, of youths now a days weh dem sighting up
And through reasoning dem biding up,
Searching for the sign and the sign is us,
Searching for the truth all you find is us,
Searching for the troops still behind is us,
The almighty we recruit and we come from the root
We build like roach building boot
Weh just can't done, Rastafari' design me tuff
If a the fight for freedom sign me up
Cause you tell-lie-vision can't blind me up
Soldiers and police dem wising up, realizing they're no more right than us
Realizing there's no use fighting us
Realizing their opening their eyes to see the same demoralizing life as us
So we nah tek talk nor smiling up
Cause the word temper tantrum boiling up,
And who alling the shots and nah bust none
Controlling the mind of the young, bring down
Bear famine, no rain nah fall from London to Dadeland mall
All the son of the virgin bawl, institute of the church in war
Preaching and researching war
Practice and rehearsing war
Teaching and dem learning war
Instigating and urging war
Always keep alert in war
Cause man will jump out a swerving car
Now bees and birds in war
And the freaks and nerds in war
And the straight and curves in war
Forward and reverse in war
Red, it red, it red, it red, it red
If you cannot do it, if you are not prepared to do it, then you will die.
You race of cowards, you race of imbeciles, you race of good for nothings
If you cannot do what other men have done
What other nations have done, what other races have done
Then you yourself shall die."
for-the-babies,2005,damian-jr-gong-marley,Hip-Hop,"This is real, this is real
Now I see them giving the woman abortion to kill another baby
Miscarriage and misfortune and premature crack baby
Strength of Rastafari, I'm hoping someday
Maybe they don't obey their parents, maybe they will obey me
Future for the babies, hopes for the babies
Tomorrow for the babies, no sorrow for the babies
Babies having babies, raising our babies
All of these young ladies, give them thanks and praises
How long can she take it? Dreams are full of maybes
Will she ever make it? Hustles on a daily, in the club a shake it
Strip down ?til she naked, don't ever mistake it
Much too real to fake it, need it then, she?ll take it
She?ll do it for the babies, a mother?s love is sacred
Now you don't ever fail me
A woman needs caring, sharing, love all the time
(No, don't you ever fail me)
A child needs loving, caring
Is there no other option than adoption for you babies
You're raffling and jacketing and auctioning your babies
Strength of Rastafari, I'm hoping someday
Maybe they don't obey their parents, maybe they will obey me
Cowards play the game thing, fathers do the brave thing
And that's participating, he keeps on concentrating
There is no debating, no running away thing
A new life is awakening from his ejaculating
It?s in the oven baking, takes two for the making
He's right there through the cravings and early morning waking
School and educating, sports and recreating
Karate and ballet thing, teenager of today thing
Fathers still relating, still communicating
And they'll always embrace him, 'cause they cannot replace him
A woman needs caring, sharing, love all the time
(No, don't you ever fail me)
A child needs loving, caring
And always do your best to keep a promise to your babies
And if you can't be good, at least be honest to your babies
The strength of Rastafari, I'm hoping someday
Maybe, they don't obey their parents, maybe they will obey me
History of the babies, beginning of the ages
You're flipping through the pages, and up and through the 80?s
Some are gang related, drug affiliated
Some intoxicated, headed for the snake pit
And Papa?s locked in cages and Mama?s lacking wages
And this is what they're faced with upon a daily basis
Bleaching out dem faces, running from dem races
Shooting up dem places, killing other babies
As bitter as the taste is and words cannot explain it
Just walk the narrow pavement and speak of love, not hatred"
move,2005,damian-jr-gong-marley,Hip-Hop,"Uh, uh-huh hmm
Babylon position the queen and set the pawn
And start transform like Deceptacon
Anytime delegates have a discrepence
Well a bare tension with some long weapons
Night vision upon the attack mission
Colaliton of folly-ticians get switch on
If you look in the face of the newly born
The newly born face malnutrition
Suspicion to what is them ambition
Total destruction start to ignition
And the world still a fight over religion
Everyone have a right to a decision
Superstition the people reflect upon, something nuh right
I man suspect a con
Cause them lost inna darkness beyond
And none shall escape except the ones, who

Boom! Chicken merry, Hawk is near
Tell them beware, but them still won't hear

Tire can't bust cause you got no spare
Whole-heap of lust in your atmosphere
Step pon di gas and you start draw gear
Dis Rastafari you do not dare
Some don't share and then that's not fair
Make a move, before they make a move and you
Making moves and still move and go thru
Moving things weh you not supposed to move
Watch your move and where you moving to
Who you move with, you move with you crew
Move some fool from up off the avenue
Move a pound and boost your revenue
Move uptown and overlook the view
Move around and get from one to two
Make a wrong move in the game you lose
I stand up and I refuse to move
Substance weh mi know mi nah go use
Metric measurement mi nah go choose
Moving on and you still need a clue
Car keys are the only keys wi' move
Moving on, Lord!

pimpa-s-paradise,2005,damian-jr-gong-marley,Hip-Hop,"And yes y'all, you now rocking with the best
Black Thought from the legendary Roots crew in the flesh
I split up in here with the brothers from the Marley family
Creston--we gon' say it for y'all
She loves to party, have a good time
She looks so hearty, feeling fine
She loves to smoke, sometimes shifting coke
Hey, she'd be laughing when there ain't no joke
Pimpa's paradise! that's all she was now
Pimpa's paradise! that's all she was
Pimpa's paradise! that's all she was now
Pimpa's paradise! that's all she was
Cause coke was a thing that once she first try
Was once a blue moon to once a blue sky
Now she's wondering who else wants to go buy
She don't got no money and wants to get high
Story sounds familiar,
Like born to be wild but she sillier
Not quite the same, but she similar
A waste of my sarsaparilla
Used to look good in the videos, now she look hideous
Now it's broken crack pipes with lipstick traces
Walks the cold nights red district places
She seen more hotels than my tour suitcases
More male customers than Old Navy's
She love lime light more than John Swaby's
Seen more miles than a Rent-A-Avis
She don't slow down then someday maybe
She lost and can't find her way to safety
Pimpa's paradise! that's all she was now
Pimpa's paradise! that's all she was
Pimpa's paradise! that's all she was now
Pimpa's paradise! that's all she was
Check it out
She keep her head up in the space like a satellite
Because she got an insatiable appetite
For staying out late nights with all the parasites
Plotting on a way to cop a little piece of paradise
Her dignity the only thing that she could sacrifice
Just get the monkey off her back and she'd be back in line
Five minutes she stay on the move,
She'd done smoked up the stone that the builder refused
All coked up alone, she ain't even in tune
And it's sad cause she ain't really have a reason to use
She was pretty girl
Cleaner than the Board of Health
Studied and enjoyed herself, I don't know what drove her to avoid herself
Destroyed herself and took a taste of the yay'
And now she on the track, working while she wasting away
It's safe to say, she looking for a someplace to stay
Who ever got a little paper to play
Can get a slice of this
Pimpa's paradise! that's all she was now
Pimpa's paradise! that's all she was
Pimpa's paradise! that's all she was now
Pimpa's paradise! that's all she was
For no reason a seasoned splif was the first thing
One spring season while she's out flirting
Now she season in and don't need rehearsing
Esteem get a beating, life is uncertain
Ego need feeding, now the wants worsen
Beneath the demons she's a warm person
When she's not fiending, swearing and cursing
Behind the curtains, she's really hurting
And while her people don't even trust her at home
The dealer dem grin and cook the rocks down
And she without sin will spark the first stone
The feeling kicks in she's in the dark zone
Old friends walk pass going 'bout their own
As if she is someone that they don't know
Then the King of Kings lift her off the floor
Saying, ""Life is a thing when you learn you grow.""
Pimpa's paradise! that's all she was now
Pimpa's paradise! that's all she was
Pimpa's paradise! that's all she was now
Pimpa's paradise! that's all she was
She rise and she fall like a star
Her life write off like a car
Her face full of all kinda scar
Always quick fi start a war
She can't keep herself up to par
She plays like a broken guitar
She always want tek it too far
I doubt she a-go mek it too far
She rise and she fall like a star
Her life write off like a car
Her face full of all kinda scar
Always quick fi start a war
She can't keep herself up to par
She plays like a broken guitar
She always want tek it too far
Mi wonder how she mek it so far"

Herbs and my locks, silky smooth way I flow

Somewhere that's warm and cozy, why not?

Yow...run barefoot without no shoes and socks
Cause she keep herself clean mi nah go catch no rash
And she love me for real mi nuh haffi have no cash
And any little thing from mi splish she splash
Yow...all this blinging it's like you forgot
Use cheddar as the bait den you recruit a rat
So we listen couple speech of Martin Luther chat
Dennis Brown, Bob Marley and some Super Cat
Yow...seem like she upside the duko shop
Cause she don't have a scratch it's only beautiful spot
When one duty start is when one duty stop
One nine to five, one five to twelve o'clock

And everything was copacet' and we began mating
And then the way mi love her good, she gimme don ratings
Because mi style dem plentiful and ah nuh one way thing
And she get belly full and ah nuh pot scrapings
And the closer we become the more she gravitating
Until we buckle down and there is no escaping
Now it typically became an everyday thing
Regularly, physically communicating sexually, scientifically penetrating
Until she start spiritually resonating
Ah so mi know she real and seh she ah nuh play thing
She is the only Queen, the King is designating
And so mi seal the deal I am negotiating

One on the treadmill, one on the bike
One in kickboxing class all night
Doing their best to work it out
Tryin' to get a nice body and a nice ""Badow""

These girls are G.R.I.T.S., 'Girls Raised In The South'

Kickin' so hard you thought she knew karate
Send a 'Thank you' to her dad and mom
'Cause once she smiles boy you know what's on
You know she has nice etiquette
But she'll laugh even though she doesn't get it yet
You want to hear her say no one can do it better

Like dust in the wind sand slips through your fingers
Similar to shattered dreams that still linger
Trying to succeed in whatever you do
But the failures of the past seem to laugh and mock you
I'm worse than a has been? 'Cause you say I never will be
I'm just tryin to excel so you feel me
'Cause boundaries are made to be broken
And I'm leavin' all the namesayers chokin'
On the dust that I'm kickin' up behind me
It's difficult findin' words to define me
The hick hop cowboy from the D-A-double L-A-S
So fresh in the contest
Rockin' stages like Guns and Roses
I been flowin' since Madonna was strikin poses
I can't quit now 'cause there's too much buzz
And I'm gettin my chance because...
[Chorus - Tim McGraw + Big Kenny]
Somebody's Smilin' On Me
Somebody's Smilin' On Me
Somebody's Smilin' On Me
Count your blessings, can't you see?
He's smilin' on you - and smilin' on me
[Verse 2 - Cowboy Troy]
I remember the days sittin' in the pews
When I heard the preacher sayin', ""Spread the news!""
I was feelin' the blues 'til I had a chance to choose
Now I feel the love to the soles of my shoes
Try to walk in a path of the guiding light
I thank the Lord for everything when I pray at night
'Cause I can feel His strength, I can feel His power
He's the one I turn to in my darkest hour
Try to be a good man, never called a saint
Never walked on water so I know I ain't
I might swim in the whiskey,
But I'm bathed in the blood of the Lamb
If you want peace raise your hand
And when Heaven comes, it won't be no drama
And if you see her first say ""Hi"" to my mama
[Chorus - Tim McGraw + Big Kenny until end]
Somebody's Smilin' On Me

Find another way to fill this loneliness (REPEAT). A married Couple with kids and a family Pet. He takes for granted that it's all good and things are set. But she feels no passion in the romance. It's been a year since they had their last slow dance. Even worse, her husband treats her like an ornament. Every other week the kids have a tournament. A team meeting, or somewhere that they gotta be. But her hearts screamin ""HEY, WHAT ABOUT ME?"" Unbeknownst another hounds in the chicken coup. And he's makin moves like a player to the hoop. She met at the gym, or was it at the grocery? It doesn't matter, 'cause you know where it's goin be	! 'Cause last year, her mister got caught cheatin. So she figure that this is gonna make them even. He thought she'd wait, like all the times before. Until he found the note she left for him hangin at the door. It read: (REPEAT CHORUS) She's 16, Callin home to her momma. After to talk 'cause she's scared of all the noise and drama. She's been gone for a week and a half. All she wants is somethin to eat and a nap. 'Cause she's a runaway. Sleepin under bridges and sleepin in alley ways. Afraid to go to the shelter, so at night she prays that hopefully she's gonna see some better days. Meanwhile, Mom and Dad are really frantic. When they saw her clothes were gone you know they really panicked. Thoughts in their minds ""Did she run to the border?"" or even worse, ""Will she be a case of Law and Order?"". The Silence in her room screams of not feelin wanted, of not bein good enough it even seems haunted. All her pain soon will be known. When she leaves her mom and dad a message after the tone. And says: (REPEAT CHORUS) If you really want to know me. I guess you better show me. Is it real or is it phony. Just love me or leave me alone. (CHORUS)"

A kiss back and a wink and ""I love you too""
Two hearts, one soul walkin' on air
Livin' on love, livin' on a prayer
Lips so sweet like chocolate
I get a rush so strong I can't forget
Love is the breeze that fills my sails
I crave to breathe what you exhale
I'll cross the desert with life at its worst

Think the same without saying a word
Your voice is the sweetest thing I've heard
Go on punkin' put this song on loop
I gotta tell you again baby, I gotta get your...

About then sweety went to the ladies room
And that's when the DJ played the boom

It's one for all and all for one
Let's live in unison, calling every citizen
It's one for all and all for one
We don't want war- can't take no more
It's drastic time for sure
We need a antidant and a cure
Coz do you really think Mohammed got a problem with Jehovah
We don't want war ? imagine if any prophet was alive
In current days amongst you and I
You think they'd view life like you and I do
Or would they sit and contemplate on why
Do we live this way, act and behave this way
We still live in primitive today
Coz the peace in the destination of war can't be the way
There's no way, so people just be 'em want to be a man
Realize that you can't change the world by changing yourself
And understand that we're all just the same
So when I count to three let's change
[Chorus]
Got no time for grand philosophy
I barely keep my head above the tide
I got this mortgage, got three kids at school
What you're saying is the truth, but really troubles me inside
I'd change the world if I could change my mind
If I could live beyond my fears
Exchanging unity for all my insecurity
Exchanging laughter for my tears
[Chorus]
I don't know, why'all, we in a real deposition
In the midst of all this negative condition
Divided by beliefs, different sink and religion
Why do we keep missing the point in our mission?
Why do we keep killing each other, what's the reason?
God made us all equal in his vision
I wish that I could make music as a religion
Then we could harmonies together in this mission
Listen, I know it's really hard to make changes
But two of us could help rearrange this curse
Utilizing all the power in our voices
Together we will unite and make the right choice
And fight for education, save the next generation
Come together as one
I don't understand why it's never been done
So let's change on the count of one
It takes one, just one
And then one follows the other one
And then another follows the other one
Next thing you know you got a billion
People doing some wonderful things
People doing some powerful things
Let's change and do some powerful things
Unity could be a wonderful thing

Uh huh
La da da da da
Sorry sorry sorry sorry
Hey, baby my nose is getting big
I noticed it be growing when I been telling them fibs
Now you say your trust's gettin' weaker
Probably 'cos my lies just started gettin' deeper
And the reason for my confession is that I learn my lesson
And I really think you have to know the truuth
Because I lied and I cheated and I lied a little more
But after I did it I don't know what I did it for
I admit that I have been a little immature
Fucking with your heart like I was the pre-da-tor
In my book of lies I was the editor
And the author
I forged my signature
And now I apologize for what I did to ya
'Cos what you did to me I did to you
Nononono baby, nononono don't lie
Nononono, yeah you kno kno kno know you gotta try
What you gonna do when it all comes out
When I see you & what you're all about
Nonono babe, nononono don't lie
Yeah you kno kno kno know you gotta try
She said I'm leaving
'Cos she can't take the pain
It's hard to continue this love it ain't the same
Can't forget the things that I've done inside her brain
Too many lies committed too many games
She feeling like a fool getting on the last train
Tryin' to maintain but the feeling won't change
I'm sorry for the things that I've done and what I became
Caught up in living my life in the fast lane
Blinded by lights, cameras, you know the fame
I don't know the reason why I did these things
And I lie and I lie
And I lie and I lie
And now our emotions are drained
'Cos I lie and I lie and a little lie lie
And now your emotions are drained
Nononono baby, nononono don't lie
Nononono, yeah you kno kno kno know you gotta try
What you gonna do when it all comes out
When I see you & what you're all about
Nonono babe, nononono don't lie
Yeah you kno kno kno know you gotta try
Ooh ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh
Ba da ba da ba da ba da badabada
Yo, I'm lying to my girl
Even though I love her
And she all in my world
I give her all my attention and diamonds & pearls
She's the one who makes me feel on top of the world
Still I lie to my girl, I do it
And I lie and I lie and I lie 'til there's no turning back
I don't know why, and I lie and I lie 'til I don't know who I am
Nononono baby, nononono don't lie
Nononono, yeah you kno kno kno know you gotta try
What you gonna do when it all comes out
When I see you & what you're all about

If you take me to the disco club

Step to the disco can't work it out
Let's get go and this party started now
Parties and getting naughty is what I'm all about
So many girlies in the house
With slanging ass bodies and perty ass mouths
After the club we're going straight to my house
(I got to, go to) Gotta get you on my couch
I rock steady, no doubt
You ask for some of us so I let you turn it out
Don't give me gomma baby, baby don't pout
I don't want a baby, momma, don't want a spouse
[Chorus: x2]
I like the way that you move (move)
Don't hold back, baby, do what you do (don't make me)

Dancing on the dance floor, getting my bulge on
(Rising) And I got a Trojan
Just in case we get it, get it going on

If you go to the disco club protect yourself and don't fall in love
The ladies in the disco club ain't the ones to be falling in love with
The ladies in the disco club ain't the ones to be falling in love with
Playa listen, yeah, I'm a Miss and I go to clubs and I sip on Cresson
That don't mean I'm like the rest of them tricks
In the party getting naughty, chasing money and dicks and
No, you got me all wrong brother
No, I'm a woman that's strong brother
Yeah, it ain't nothing wrong with a woman in the club getting freaky to the song
Monday at the disco club

Thursday at the disco club
Friday at the disco club
Saturday at the disco club
Sunday at the disco club
Every day's the disco club
See us at the disco club
See you at the disco club
We gonna break it on down
Rub it on your belly like a ultrasound
Shake it like a jelly and move around
Really want to see y'all flaunt your style
Get wild, baby, get a little crazy
Don't hesitate, won't take no/maybe
(Move) not like an eviction
But me and you baby all cause friction
Hm, as my eyed undress you
Just want to let you know there's no pressure
Body conversation, they both want pleasure
But your girl cock-blocked and won't let you
Hm, what you gonna do now
Bounce, rock, shake and we can all while out
Let it all flow like a river now
Check me, check me, check ch-check me on out
If the ladies in the disco club
Are freaking in the disco club
And dancing in the disco club
And shaking in the disco club
If you take me to the disco club

gone-going-gone,2005,black-eyed-peas,Hip-Hop,"Johnny want to be a big star
Get on stage and play the guitar
Make a little money, buy a fancy car
Big old house and an alligator
Just to match with them alligator shoes
He's a rich man so he's no longer singing the blues
He's singing songs about material things
And platinum rings and watches that go bling
But, diamonds don't bling in the dark
He a star now, but he ain't singing from the heart
Sooner or later he's just gonna fall apart
Cause his fans can't relate to his new found art
He ain't doing what he did from the start
And that's putting in some feeling and thought
He decided to live his life shallow
Cash in his love for material
And its gone, gone, going,
Gone, everything gone, give a damn,
Gone be the birds when they don't want to sing,
Gone people, up awkward with their things, gone.
You see yourself in the mirror
And you feel safe cause it looks familiar
But you afraid to open up your soul
Cause you don't really know, don't really know
Who is, the person that's deep within
Cause you are content with just being the name brand man
And you fail to see that its trivial
Insignificant, you addicted to material
I've seen your kind before
Your the type that thinks souls is sold in a store
Packaged up with incense sticks
With them vegetarian meals
To you that's righteous
You're fiction like books
You need to go out to life and look
Cause, what happens when they take your material
You already sold your soul and its
And its gone, gone, going,
Gone, everything gone, give a damn,
Gone be the birds when they don't want to sing,
Gone people, up awkward with their things, gone.
You say that time is money and money is time
So you got mind in your money and your money on your mind
But what about, that crime that you did to get paid
And what about, that bid, you can't take it to your brain
Why you on about those shoes you'll wear today
They'll do no good on the bridges you've walked along the way
All that money that you got gonna be gone
That gear that you rock gonna be gone
The house up on the hill gonna be gone
The gold, on your grill gonna be gone
The ice on your wrist gonna be gone
That nice little Miss gonna be gone
That whip that you roll gonna be gone
And what's worst is your soul will be gone
And its gone, gone, going,
Gone, everything gone, give a damn,
Gone be the birds when they don't want to sing,
Gone people, up awkward with their things, gone."

Up in the studio laying tracks
Burn it on the CD, melt the wax
And now I'm feeling fine
Coz daily music's on my mind
And I feel mellow
When I watch the girl play the cello
Hello to all my fellow peers in here for the quality
Music quality, yeah

Verse 1
A lot of love lost your days is getting cloudy now I'm gonna see how many can really stand the rain
Bumpy back again analytical still working out twice a day like it's critical still mix a lot keep it spiritual
Mic still hot still lyrical and you niggaz hate to see me rise
I ain't got no more patience you can see it in my eyes
I'm sick of niggaz keeping me in lies, I hear ya talking
I'm New York nigga I rep it every time I step it evn though I'm well respected I got a weapon your past is terrible your future's worse
Let me put this Walter PP all in ya mouth cock it and shoot you first
Your shit ain't phat ain't no pun to that cause I make this hardcore gansta shit so fun to rap
You in trouble like no gun to clap in the middle of Pakistan
Either you fight or you clap your hand
Cause weak niggaz can't ever be sincere
I'm the hardest sober hardcore beats in ya ear
And I'm graceful like Muhhamad Ali opposing war
I ain't trying to be no soldier that don't konw what he's fighting for
That's hypocritic if I'm shooting up my block over 150$ size rocks
I'm a stop fucking with niggaz like Jenny from the block
Cause all you want to do is come in the club and bust shots
You see a man who exposes himself when he's intoxicated really don't know the art of getting drunk
Bumpy Knux bring funk like a musty black man from Gahn I rip through Mc's like a peronous
Run up on me if ya want to I'll cock my resolution like I was Hughey Newton plottin revolution what ya'll rappers call 16 Barz I call polution so fuck you and your distribution
I'm the self mad dollar blue colar rockwilder
Yes I weigh more 265 I weigh more I guess I got my weight up
I send you 16 Barz I ate up
All you punch line niggaz I'll put you in a line and punch every one of you
now you know your purpose
I'm the bible of the ghetto and page by page
I wote ya'll a manual on the black man rage
I'll chae you till I catch that ass I guess I'm like age
And I kill gansta rappers too I guess I'm like AIDS
Take it Easy Eazy does it and ya'll wanna spit bitch in the club being a sleezy buzzit
Two years was my interlude I fixed my imperfection I got my mind in better shape to spit you the Konexion
Now that I got that off my Chest

See I know there's a lot of rappers right
You give 'em some real akward shit like this

See it's to make 'em lazy crazy ""Lazy!!!""

I make short people pay me cause that's way I MAKE MY EARNINGS
Keep it right you keep your life
I don't want to be in fun in your house WITH MY FOUR POUNDS BURNIN'
Cause I will give you a light
I'ma hardcore nigga from downtown so NIGGAS CAN FEEL ME
Cause I'm hard when I deliver
But I won't stop wocking at heart signs SO NIGGAS CAN'T HEAL ME
I ring god when I deliver
I'm straight from the strongest isle AND I GOT NO -?-
And get wild in any burrow
To my warriors on Riker's Isle I HOPE YOU ALL CAN HEAR ME
Make 'em nice and be this thorough
With a nation of hip hop with everybody down here ROLLIN'
Cause it's Bump takin' the lead
I'm not down with ya hypocrisy FUCK AROUND GET STOLEN
Cause I peal niggaz for greed
Stop grinnin' in a motherfucker face WHEN YOU KNOW YOU DON'T LIKE ME
You get slapped the bitchy way
You can put a bunch of brawl in your voice BUT YOU DON'T SOUND LIKE ME
You get J stay with your way
If you beef without my two-aim PLEASE BE A THUG AND SIGN IT!
Cause it's day for you to hide
I put your body in a river N-why-P-D WON'T FIND IT
And I pray for you to die
I'm Bump nigga how many times I got to tell you BUMPY
Freddie Foxxx his other half
And I'll thump nigga right from the heart SO YOU NIGGAS CAN -?- ME
I don't waste none the air baby ""Lazy!!!""
[Chorus] (2x)
Everybody you know, everybody we know (Come on, that's right)
want to spit a rhyme on a beat by the Primo ""Lazy!!!""
But everybody I know and everybody you know
Know that's one thing not everybody can do though ""Lazy!!!""
[Verse 2]
Bump bringin' you another selection FROM MY MAIN MAN PRIMO
To the heart forever plural
For blessin' hip hop with the one nigga PRODUCERS CAN'T SEE THOUGH
To the end should by our girl
If it takes me a lifetime to prove I'm THE NICEST MC
Then I'm down for every war
And if it ever get bigger than rap THEN I GET MY SHIT be
Come on down, I'm holdin' fours
I hate to be pain in the ass CAUSE IT REALLY AIN'T LIKE ME
But I couldn't help but notice
You come into this game with a mask AND SNEAK AROUND LIKE WIFEY
And get popped like shooky sodas
Rap voters get Al Gored, which means low scores
On all the music awards
It's all good though, niggaz from the street DON'T SWEAT NO TROPHY
Cause it don't make you hot
Aiyyo Roy I'm the heavyweight champ of hip hop WALK LIGHTLY
Some of y'all must've forgot
Means nothing to me if another nigga got a Knuckle CAN TRUST ME
And I swear that forever
Cause I ever take a ass-whipping dude YOU WOULD HAVE TO BUST ME
Pretty much I'm sayin'; Whatever
See I punish MC's that come in with big dough
Cause I know they gonna pay they way right too slow
These Hollywood niggaz from the hood better know
I'm so ever soul forever flow
Always quick to they spine I'm never slow
I'm probably something you don't want to do, let it go
Basketball players, boxers, wrestlers
Don't take it personal cause I'll get the best of ya
Ask these sorry-ass RAPPERS
They know I'm so CRAZY"
step-up,2003,freddie-foxxx,Hip-Hop,"[verse 1]
Did you ever have a girl and you thought she was it
To find out in the long run she ain't even shit
Dress her up nice, sport her all over town
And then behind your back she likes sleepin around
She's steppin out late while you're home in bed
To another brother kickin bass all in her head
You're layin there, lookin at her photo in frame
And you're chirpin like a bird while you're singin her name
You call her every night, then you're off by 10
When you hang up the phone, she hits the road again
Sad what I'm sayin, but it's gotta be true
Everybody knows your girl better than you
But what I'm sayin is this: you said she'd never do wrong
You met her at first, she did a dancin song
Said I'll stay with you forever and brighten your world
Face it, somebody bumpin your girl
Somebody else bumped your girl
And the thought of it wrecked your world
Somebody else bumped your girl
It makes you mad, don't it?
Somebody else bumped your girl
And the thought of it wrecked your world
Somebody else bumped your girl
It make you ill, won't it?
[verse 2]
I met this kid named jesse on my way uptown
Sittin on the train, on his face was a frown
I said my man, what's the matter? then he started to sweat
Said my girl left the crib, and she didn't come home yet
Foxxx, I'm hurt, sad as could be
Cause everytime she leaves, she always calls me
But I ain't heard a word, I'm worried to death
I can't understand why she up and just left
How long has it been? he said about six days
And man, I did a lotta prayin, and I hope that it pays
I looked him in his face, told him don't be a cad
Cause ain't a girl in the world, it's insanity, mad
You better start thinkin and preparin your heart
Cause if you hear the wrong thing, you'll be torn apart
Jesse stood up, the train came to a stop
Had a look on his face like he was about to pop
I said so what's up? then he looked in my grill
Kinda like I look myself when I'm bout to get ill
He was lookin on a platform, right by a can
His girl lockin lips with another man
Jesse broke stupid, and pulled out a tool
And started lickin off like a crazy fool
The brother went rambo, actin wild
And shot sixteen people at the turnstyle
The girl got sick when she saw blood flowin
The brother she was with did a jesse owens
I couldn't believe the brother ruined his world
All because somebody else bumped his girl
Somebody else bumped your girl
And the thought of it wrecked your world
Somebody else bumped your girl
It makes you mad, don't it?
[verse 3]
Now i'ma tell you all a story bout my man jim stone
Who had a three-floor mansion and a yacht of his own
He had enough money, but what capes the cake
He had the baddest girl in about 10 states
All about he ever talked about was lovin his girl
And how he'd never touch another in the whole wide world
Jim got the nerve, wants to buy her a ring
And when he put it on her finger, she was ready to sting
The brother had a party at his crib one night
Had the place laid out, and the music was hype
About 100 people, I would say, no less
Freddie foxxx ain't stupid, I can knowledge a mess
I noticed his girl, she kept grinnin a lot
She was hangin round the fireplace in this one spot
She looked like she was waitin for a train or a bus
She was waitin for jim's best man, his boy gus
Gus got slick, took the girl by the hand
And dipped the step like the bionic man
I stood there shakin my head, I had a flashback
Bout what happened uptown by the traintracks
Jim came over and he said to me fred
I got a real bad thought bumrushin my head
I said so what's the matter? then he looked at me twice
And said I can't find my best man gus or my wife
Jim was on a mission, I could look in his eyes
And see the meter on his blood pressure startin to rise
He headed up the steps and I followed behind
And I could tell by his face he had death on his mind
He stood by the room and the door was cranked
Then he took off his shirt, and then we both stepped back
Jim kicked the door open and he stuck in his head
And saw gus and his wife both naked in bed
Jim grabbed a bat, and I tell you the truth
He was swingin homeruns like my man babe ruth
He left em both layin there, stiff as a board
And he turned to me and said freddie foxxx, I scored
Two accounts murder one, now he sits in his cell
With a life-long sentence and a story to tell
I couldn't believe the brother ruined his world
All because somebody bumped his girl
Somebody else bumped your girl
And the thought of it wrecked your world
Somebody else bumped your girl
It makes you mad, don't it?
Somebody else bumped your girl
And the thought of it wrecked your world
Somebody else bumped your girl
It make you ill, won't it?

Verse 1
Yo, yo, yo, listen
It's the MCs time- for spittin the rhyme,
Believe, I be in the ring gettin the mind,
I'm the word in your dialect that's hard to define,
Like unity, no man gets immunity
I rhyme for your community
On a Harley (Davidson), throttle in my right hand
Left on the molly (?)
With the muffler, lookin for to toughin ya
Feelin like a burnin in ur belly, when I get to warmin up in ya
I see u niggas in kill mode, then u see me in kill mode
then u in chill mode, my twin glocks still load
Nigga I'll make you roadkill
Then bump in you in kill road (?)
On the highway i spit the verse my way,
and never say another niggas rhyme, that's biting
not homage
you need to stop writing
that garbage
I won't let you, let him tell them
That bumpy ain't spittin that hardcore phlegm"

Yeah
So fresh so clean
When I step in the booth they scream
Like they all tend to cheer (?)
Dungeon D-boy here
In effect mode like Who's to Love it? so slow motion
Like 3 wheels and triple cheeseburgers ATL coastin (say no more!)
But the pimp is one of the coolest but I (pay no more)
Been known to rock the big blocks and colorful gay toys
With the flip-flops, and the silk socks and a Kangol to the tip top
I flow hard you drip drop
Cleaner than the urine of a two time felons piss test
I'm sitting in some Monte Carlo curse right in the headrest
White Guts
White Wall tires

It's so fire!
Fire meaning breathing like a dragon and it's seeming that I'm
Falling into a world of my own

Falling into a world of my own

How I'm riding these days keep me with the right sluts
He's just Bubba happen to love the D.F.
You in the midst of history Betty take a deep breath
Sitting on the tailgate polo to the boxers

But the cutest nigga out the group
Gotcha head spinnin like tread on a spool
Clean as a fool
With them gold shoes oooooh!
And I got that pool
Make you want to HOLLA!
Seen in my impala hear them flow-

There's this one in my stable

It has a signature wood grain steering wheel such as yours
But oh my God what are harder are the hard wood floors
It's not coincidental all the glass was kept clear
Who's worried his or her first shit it's freezing it here
The only heat is my piece to make it even at least
I'll go to work without even catching a crack in my crease
I guess the dubs out there do what they 'posed to do
I'll ride 15mph to make a believers out of you
I got a lawsuit, pending charge for wreckless blade spinnin

I'm op-timistic, I'm the air in the open road
Make ya move it's moderate, no need to speed
It's inevitable you arrive in due time indeed

In each others love we puddle, huddle - break, fourth down, and inches

Up the same stream that I'm folding
On the new ride?

It's makin' me want to be with someone (tonight)
Make her feel (so right)

Around the clock

I can breath at least

And to this ain't the snuff so obtain the spluf
Cellophane of reef
Trade your grief
For these magic beans
Crown the stop
Ride the clouds
Surf the waves
An earth decays
Expose your soul
Never close your soul
Slow your role
Never overload your soul
Hold your goes
Never lose sight of those
I suppose
We can all float away
As it goes
We can all know the way
If we prose
We can share the way
No one knows
We can all go today
If we chose
We can all roll away
Until you're truly ready to say, ""Fuck your fear!""
You are not alive
You don't have to settle and be stuck right here
You can let me drive
Come and ride the roller-coaster
Give all the troubles of the world to me
At least come and see, come see the other side

What I need, what I want, what I see
Is two different things, two different...

Origin purpose be partially profound of the very power that's in me

Let the complexity collapse the pocket quickly
Life is but a dream, ya row ya boat gently

Yet I ponder why, I smoke my presence prominently?

Euphoric you raw superstitions, appear with information
Hesitation, metaphoric in a solid state of logic
Focusin' on me and the family, gawkin'
Parallel parkin' was a art form
Atilla the Hun, school that I wrote to write
Spoke for some to speak, provided cobblestone
Stole to steal parone, cut the heart up out of Caesar
I protect the black Madonna shrine from seizures
I survived the 80's child killings
Excruciating pain like a root canal without a filling
Forever we, pillars in this stature in this Ascap rapture
Wordplay that will snatch ya, mangle ya mind
Signed upper bull pull, I relinquish
To become forever more Excalibur
To become forever more Excalibur

Indicated capture, syncopated nature

But they major players, so I'm a gladiatin'

Fuck what flag we wavin', kids is misbehavin'

Sworn away my freedom through words that sing my freedom
Rebirth the world of the earth in intent to spin my freedom
Prepared to defend the next-us didn't get in for no Lexus
Didn't get on through connections or to get off my erection

Bucket that caused the detection sent to impossible reactions

Promise to make it show that, the legend of dungeon live on
Even knowledge I known and heights I flown
I alone can't snatch the sword up out the stone
The charged chastities here, have to cock outta fear
Matter of fact, I apologize
Lyric far, witness to suck the star
May the force be with us, for we are

From the jump, keep it still to relapse on that junk
Pump fake, off ya feet
Fall on this sword ya beat with eggs on ya face
Amazing grace, how sweet it is the shit we spit
Thicker still, niggaz don't deserve to live
It's gettin' so goosy where a girl
Can kill her baby the next day by takin' a pill
Breakin' off beat, when they blow the horns
They open up the rest of them seals
Out wit yo' head for not keepin' the ears real
Walkin' through the valley of the drop
Bone lookin' for my damn drone
Where ya at? I see ya, I see ya
Come on let's get 'em dawg come on
If I got one my nigga you got one
He got one, they got one

You've been thinking,
I've been thinking,
But we should be talking.
Our hearts apart are coming to their own assumptions.
They're still in love and,
We need to need to know that,
There's nothing else to prove.
Why you hesitate,
About debating on the real?
Why you acting like,
I'm not your friend,
I'm just your girl.
Why you tryna keep on hiding what I know you feel.
Why you wanna fight alone?

my-apology,2005,floetry,Hip-Hop,"Karma usually comes wearing the stranger's light
It's easier to deal with that way
But now it's you, I've hurt you, disrespected you
There's nowhere to hide, no turning back, no rearrangement
Only what lies ahead and you're so Heaven sent
I know you're feeling hurt because of what I did to you
If it's blame I'll take it maybe we will make it through
'Cause I love you, I love you, think about it baby
I'm sorry for giving you the cold shoulder
Never been this wrong before
Never stood my ground and breathed it in before
All I wanted to do is hold ya
Never felt so brave and so afraid before
Never faced alone and felt the peace before
With tears in my eyes I come to you sincerely
Excepting this space I'm in
Growing outta the phase where I just wanna win
You act as though you don't even hear me
Look at me baby look at me I know you
I know you're feeling hurt because of what I did to you
If it's blame I'll take it maybe we will make it through
'Cause I love you, I love you, think about it baby
Growth I released my grief it was a heavy load
Survived the sleep and now I'm letting go
Waking up and living up to what I had proposed
Woman now I love the girl I used to be
Ever step she took was reaching out to me
Every breath is blessed responsibility, we made it baby
I can't control your feelings, feel me
I can't take back, what I've done
With my hand on my heart
I'm coming to you sincerely if you hear me I know you
I know you're feeling hurt because of what I did to you
If it's blame I'll take it maybe we will make it through
I love you, I love you, think about it baby
I know you're feeling hurt because of what I did to you
If it's blame I'll take it maybe we will make it through
'Cause I love you, I love you, think about it baby
Baby think about it we know better
But love has no expectations
So I don't expect you to do anything
Think about it
This is for me I'm offering this to you
To free myself
'Cause I know what I have to do
This is my apology think about it baby"

Could it be the Grammy tingwhy they are malicing
Or is it because I link with Dave Kelly why them panicking
While I'm rocking it

You, somebody talk, you in they mouth like a dentist
We keep it gangsta, mommas love it 'cause they know it's real

Big Ball, Fatboy, unload heat when my brain spill
You for it, images without no coke connect pills
We keep it crunk and poppin' real niggaz know the deal
We Bad Boys, anywhere we at we smoke and kill
You try to stop it, get yo' shit broke up in twenty pieces
We roll deep in brand new vehicles wit secret features
Game preachers move yo' pimpin' for you mamasitas
We players on the field, y'all niggaz in them bleachers

Lost a knockoff or his tight-ass shirt when the button pop off
You standin' it's snowin' you got yo' shoes and socks on
Who holds the key? No fucking 'bout it, I broke the lock off
I grew the top off, took the comma, period, dot off
And ran on wit it and broke you a whole lot off
I'm gettin' hot and startin' to boil, don't turn the pot off
You just affected wit it, pimpin' yo, get yo' rocks off
Release some pressure, stop all that cryin' and wipe yo' snot off
Excuses you be usin' for losin' it's cheap as hot sauce
Earn yo' position, stop hatin' because you not boss
MJG, pimp tight, I'm movin' yo' spot off
And I don't reach, stoppin' yo' plans, fucking yo' plot off
I go hard and I don't sheave and I'm not off
And livin' on the edge rebellin' I'm never dropped off

Now you can either check yo' ego at the do' or let
The drama unfold and check my rap sheet, bitch
I'm almost ten million sold, I'm only rappin' cause I want to
I got enough plaques, needless to say, my favorite
Rappers told me to get on this track and so I did it
Quickly wrote my sixteen down and spit it
By the end of the verse you'll say, once again, Ludacris, sit it
Then I'll wipe this wit yo' face and put yo' pride in the trash
My whole career is like my video, I'm showin' my ass
I keeps it, ""Gangsta, gangsta!"", shooters and shanksters
Until you shot off motherfuckers, I'm a thank you, thank you
Runnin' yo' mouth behind my back until you run out of time but
At least yo' talkin' let's me know some millions stay on yo' mind
It ain't nothin' wrong wit that tell em grabbin' the thang
And then I put it to yo' brain and change everything
You ever hope fo' wit the .44 you'll be fallin' back and yacht
Is what I'm drinkin' steady thinkin' 'bout these pigs chasin'
I'm 'bout to bring home the bacon
You talkin' down behind my back

memphis-city-blues,2004,eightball-mjg,Hip-Hop,"Said I got the blues
Said I got the blues
Memphis city blues
Yeah, light up the green, watch me light up the room
Watch me light up the mic, fat boy, be the truth
Nigga live and learn, learn the streets or get burned
Niggas take what you earn, they be slick as a perm
Man I try to be slicker, try to be cunning and quicker
Try to be more than just another broke ass nigga
In this game of life, lose your life in the game
Take a life full of pain, make you remember my name
From the home of the blues, thought I paid my dues
It's hard to fill my shoes, imitators abuse
I just love the music, like my heart and my brain
Couldn't live without it, that's impossible man
I'm unstoppable man, from the bottom I came
Niggas scratching for bread, stumbled up on the fame
Humble niggas with game, shut yo' mouth up and listen
Recognize, it's a blessing, thankful just to be living
I got the Memphis City Blues
Ooo, I could feel it now
The neighborhood pimps introduced us to pimping
And everybody we know used to play in them streets
Oh man, oh man, oh man
I got the Memphis City Blues
Ooo, I could feel it now
The neighborhood pimps introduced us to pimping
(This is how they put it down)
Everybody we know used to play in them streets
(We know)
Oh man, oh man, oh man
I had the Memphis City Jones running through my bones
Way, way back with A+ beepers and gray phones
Even further back when I was just playing around the yard
Riding bikes and shit, falling and getting my legs scarred
In the music city, Memphis Tenn, they turned me into this
My dad and a couple of my friends, they played instruments
And when we used to roll to school at 16
We bumped shit like Bobby Womack and Al Green
Hell, I knew most of the old school shit from front to end
I would start to memorize, four fives at age 10
I come from a city where R&B; run deep
And the blues was the music that paved the whole street
It was only natural that we would take the torch and run wit it
Be serious, but still have a little fun wit it
MJG, from a town that runs real deep
Ask B.B. King and Isaac Hayes on Beale Street
I got the Memphis City Blues
Ooo, I could feel it now
The neighborhood pimps introduced us to pimping
And everybody we know used to play in them streets
Oh man, oh man, oh man
I got the Memphis City Blues
Ooo, I could feel it now
The neighborhood pimps introduced us to pimping
(This is how they put it down)
Everybody we know used to play in them streets
(We know)
Oh man, oh man, oh man
Yeah, on that pimping man, me and G was born and raised
Commodores, O Jays, Frankie Beverly and Maze
Windows rolled down, no AC cause the gas low
Bread at a minimum, but still we found a place to go
North to the South at my nigga house, chiefing out
Skipping school, learning what the Memphis City Blues 'bout
Me and G and a whole bunch of others
Had a rocky road to travel just to make the world love us
'Cause it's the Memphis City, really to call it itty bitty
Would be an understatement
We got big ass, cash, and titties
Big pimping working and hurt, the pockets of big tippers
Side dippers and big jails to hide niggas
But we stayed out, hard times, we prayed bout 'em
Nigga step up talking that shit and I laid out 'em
MJG rappin' the Memphis Tennie, you and I could feel it
Pass me some of the henny
I got the Memphis City Blues
Ooo, I could feel it now
The neighborhood pimps introduced us to pimping
And everybody we know used to play in them streets
Oh man, oh man, oh man
I got the Memphis City Blues
Ooo, I could feel it now

Heyyy
See a nigga like me gonna get money till I get rich
Ride with a couple hundred G's in a biscuit
Stay down for whatever forever hustle with my mystic hoes
And soon you gonna see just how crunk this shit be once we get rich
'Til then it's back to hustlin' with my misfits
Deep, on a creep, fifty songs tucked under the prone
Fifty songs tucked under the prone
I keep a big old nigga beater heater
It's in the trunk of my four-door and my two seater
I'm make them say skeeter skeeter
Keep up and grab the ball back just like I'm Derek Jeter
I know you want to fuck my hoe but you too scared to meet her
See you ain't got enough bread to even start to treat her
The way a pimp did, and in the bed I'm even sweeter
I hustle, I got more Franklins in me than Aretha
If I had Oprah Winfrey, I would marry her and keep her
I spit as much knowlege as preachers and teachers
Just as long as the message reach us we all fill up the bleachers
I'm the M J G, I get in yo' shit
I ain't trying to run yo' clique, that be your friend so quick
Come on, where my money, let me hit the stage
Fuck them long interviews, just give us the front page
Black G apostrophe S us, forever bust
Them lyrics that make the people say that he got nuts
See a nigga like me gonna get money till I get rich

Sticky weed kickin' in, big Ball steppin' in
Straight flying when I hustle, thats how I represent
Bounce, if you feelin' what I'm spitting up in your ear hole
I been rocking mics since I was 17 years old
Smoking up, drinking up, kicking dust, and fucking up
Everybody want a piece and we ain't got enough for us
Yeah, I touched a brick or two, pounds I done smoked a few
Got my bread and didn't do what the fuck I was supposed to do
Money blinds players, turns them into evil spirits
Niggaz die trying to live out these old rap lyrics
I try to give it to them just how it come to me
Real and unedited, not like it be on TV
Be myself and don't be what those haters want me to be
Take the good the bad hit my knees set me free
Make the bad good, put that on my leather and wood
Cinderella with my fellas deep off in the hood

See a nigga like me gonna get money till I get rich
Ride with a couple hundred G's in a biscuit
Stay down for whatever forever hustle with my mystic hoes
And soon you gonna see just how crunk this shit be once we get rich
'Til then it's back to hustlin with my misfits
Deep, on a creep, fifty songs tucked under the prone
Fifty songs tucked under the prone
You need to stop sticking your hand out and trying to fold it
Turn around the broom handle and trying to hold it
It's plenty dirt to be swept, and leaves to be raked
Now you need to leave from my face, take heed to mistake
That you just made, thinking a player could get played
Thinking that a rapper could get wrapped and phone tapped
My whole life I learned the hard way to spot liars
And it seems like it's usually the ones thats right by ya
Fire
Jumping up out the tip with pistols sittin' up
Fuck me? Watch my gun skeet like it's bussing nuts
'Cept when it hit your cheek it burn then it split your cheek
Then come out the back of your head, now your just a memory
Graphic how I got it illustrated, rated triple X
Niggaz want to be the king, I don't give a fuck who's best
Just watch your mouth, talkin' down in the south
I'm gonna let my nuts hang and start punching clowns out
See a nigga like me gonna get money till I get rich
Ride with a couple hundred G's in a biscuit
Stay down for whatever forever hustle with my mystic hoes
And soon you gonna see just how crunk this shit be once we get rich

So will you dip with me baby girl
On a trip around the world while I play with your curls
Play with your titty nipples will that make your toes curl
You a bad motherfucker baby it's your world
I know I'm coming on strong but that's me
Whatever you want I can do it correctly
So get ya mind right baby you Tina and I'm Ike
Bring that ass over here dance with Ike or we gon' fight
What it do baby girl
Get on the dance floor
Will you put your drink down
Come and dance with me
What it do baby girl
Get on the dance floor
Will you put your drink down
Come and dance with me"
gangsta,2004,eightball-mjg,Hip-Hop,"We represent it to the fullest
Keep it gangsta mang
You know them niggas from the dirty
Do them gangsta thangs
Hoes love it when I pull up in my big ol' truck
They smokin good
With that crocodile touchin they butt
Call it what'chu want
I do it with the best
Spit it how I live it
Fat Boy, he dange-ress
Watch what'cha say
My squad don't play
My hood like Viagra
Make you hard all day
Don't talk about it, be
About it like a G
I pop it like a Ruger
Semi-automatically
Ya girlfriend love it
She tell me when I see her
She hate'chu like you hate me
I rock it like Aaliyah
Back and forth, up and down
Harder, and deeper
She hit me on my cell-phone, e-mail and beeper
A regular nigga with makin money on my mind
A young street hustla
Always on the grind
See me when ya see me
Never know when I be pullin up
Four-door, foreign, or big rims on American truck
That's me with the clouds comin out the roof
On the street or in the booth, yo
Grand Hustle!
T.I.P!
Let's go!
Ohhh!
Aye nigga
Call it what'chu want
I give it to ya real
Spit it how I live it pimp
It is what it is
They can't kick it where I kick it
They ain't live how I live
Ain't just another run of the mill rapper with a deal
Wanna push my buttons?
Tryin'a test my limits?
Been in shoot-outs
But thanks to my vest, I'm livin
All these so called villains
Who act like women
Really make me sick
Don't make me stick this
Fourty-fo' desert and elope yo slip
Un-load this clip
Til' the gun go ""click! ""
Niggas wanna try Tip
I'm a do him like this
Paint a picture, draw a Chopper
And erase his clique
Send some niggas to ya house
That'cha didn't invite
Do some thangs to ya wife
That'll damage ya life
I don't think you can imagine
What that's bout to be like
Instead of bitchin all the time
Ya should be tryin to do right
Put a slug in ya mug
Make ya piss in ya shorts
Have ya mama at the wake
Cryin, kissin ya corpse
Yeah, I know the ice is shining
I'm a glisten, of course
And y'all niggas still whining
Like some bitches and whores
I ain't gon' stop grindin
Until I see my pitch and fork
No, I'm a be richer than you
My pops was richer than yours
It's extradition
I know y'all niggas wishin me dead
But I keep it pimpin instead
Get this shit in ya head
Call it what'chu want
Well, I'm pullin up in a big ol' truck
I looked in my rear-view, I saw a big ol' butt (Daaamn!)
I'm like ""Hey Ms. Parker, when you gon' let me fuck!? ""
She said ""When you put some 23's on ya truck""
So I flipped me a brick in a couple of days
I hit the mall for throw-backs and couple of Jay's
And don't jack!
Cause you will catch a couple of strays
Cause me, Ball, and T.I.
Pack a couple of K's
Cause we some gangstas
And you a motherfuckin wanksta
Get out-of-line and I'm a have to come shank ya
Cause I'm ""Trill"" with' a ""Pocket Full of Stones""
You know I'm ridin dirty
Talkin' on my Sprint phone
My paint dubbed two-tone
I'm sittin on Lorenz'
Cause down in Texas
We roll twenty-twen' twens
And we, bang Screw (Bang Screw)

Looking just like the rims on the Chevy
Pimp twist I'm a playa still, ballin' in the game come major bills
Come and take a trip with me to hater Ville
On some 24 omegas and gator grill fuck a twist
Fuck you bitch, I don't really wanna have to bust you bitch
Roman gold shine so hard niggaz out here
Know they can't touch that shit
I don't trip, niggaz pull up
I be lookin' proud when I bust that Dutch
Specially when I look at the mac in the black Cadillac
And the bubbles in the Hummer truck
When you see a nigga cruise through
Niggaz try to jack you and loose my coop is by the kennel wheels
Mother fucker wanna take my style
'Cause niggaz out here know I'm only fuckin' with the bonnet grills
And the haters wanna see me fall
How can I let y'all niggaz play me
Shited on their good then I pull up
From my vehicle while bumpin' 8 Ball & MJG
Twista bitch and I from the shy
With my Memphis connect and I ain't going' lie
We be specializing in and up coming with dope shit
And pulling up in cool whips that's fly
Still drink, still blow, then I creep through the hood real slow

Money players is demon like I'm willy beamin'
Like a bitch that practice suckin' dick and drinkin' semen
She sceamin', dreamin', wishin' she can be my number one
Forever young, mama I just wanna' to have some fun
Don't try to ever take my cash from me
You mine as well, jump of a cliff you fuckin' crash dummy
Like that's my last money
This for my niggaz who be bussin' back to perpetrators

confessions,2004,eightball-mjg,Hip-Hop,"And it's hard
Hard
Yeah, yeah, sittin' looking out my window, the streets I see ain't pretty
Sometimes I wonder if I was born rich with plenty
Money, and everyday was sunny didn't no rain fall
Life was beautiful like the colors of a rainbow
Would I be the same prim row, all my niggaz know
If I didn't have to learn to beat them streets and get that dough
What if I never witnessed killings with my own two eyes
Bussin' leave they own folks, layin' in the street to die
Life without respective if every second I was shakin'
'Cause I injected dope in my veins
Divide and strain, could I describe pain
Could I describe livin' life without desire mayne
Could I survive if I couldn't rap or entertain
Alive and free you can't beat it, who can you blame
My world is like a picture and the frame
The picture might change but the frame stays the same
Hustling waiting on tomorrow
Living life in the fast lane
'Cause no one ever knows
No one ever knows
Sitting here waiting on tomorrow
Putting paper away
'Cause no one ever knows
No one ever knows
What if you was on the other end of the bullet
When a killer wanna pull it would it seem like
The light flash in front of your face
Or would you run real slow like I ran in my dream like
Just the other day, I tried to be
A hero but it wasn't the side of me
Or maybe it just wasn't the time to be
But if the shoe had to fit then I would be
Ahead of the game playin' the part
I bring it all into the light from out of the dark
I hit the bat into the ball and out of the park
And live with the question alone that's meddlin' hard
What if you had to live under the bridge and do
Anything just to feed your kids
Think about that and the deed you did
The first thing that impress me kid, oh yes, you did
And I ain't even tryna choke your chain or pull your leg
And I ain't even tryna fuck with your head
And I ain't even tryna sweat this shit
Just spit these messages 'cause I'm blessed with it
What if you had the chance to be
Able to switch hands with me or anyone you see
And if you really wanna take it deep
This shit not quanum to me
For one and each and each and all
For the sci-fi mat, more religious superstitious
Politicious and all the listeners
With us this shit be cold as Christmas
So put your head to the sky say a prayer
For the sick and the old the young and the weak
For the bombs and the single moms
With six kids askin for something to eat
Hustling waiting on tomorrow
Living life in the fast lane
'Cause no one ever knows
No one ever knows
Sitting here waiting on tomorrow
Putting paper away
'Cause no one ever knows
No one ever knows
And when you get up they seem to hold you down
Down to the ground, gotta stay focused
With your eyes opened wide, se the sun rise
I keep my hands on the steering wheel when I'm creepin' up 75
Changing lanes on the regular talkin' on my cellular fast
Watching 'cause they wanna take me away
I'm just trying to feed my babies face
But I'm just hustling, I'm waiting on tomorrow
Hustling waiting on tomorrow
Living life in the fast lane
'Cause no one ever knows
No one ever knows
Sitting here waiting on tomorrow
Putting paper away
'Cause no one ever knows
No one ever knows
And the only way is to keep your head on right
Oh yeah"

Baby, come on you know I wrote compositions
That make niggaz wish they never spoke while they were spittin
I'm so ready I'm bout to blow from the tension

Cant throw my position, I flow with persition
Is a must a keep it on the low in addition
To all my weapons and no ammunition

10 1/2 for your eyes and your pretty toes
I wanna know you but I heard you got a nigga though
Anyway I'ma spit it like I know that you with it
My windows are tinted so he won't know that you in it
We can cruise the city and get the car, we's in it
Drink a hen open up and let your boy squeeze in it
A G for real I never played those games
Wanna get in your brain, put some ice in your chain
You can stay with your manne, act a fool and complain
Come and get with your boy we just hang and bang
That's the business but you don't want a niggaa like me
You want a weak ass nigga just pretendin to be

I wish I would've said somethin
That would've made you stopped walkin

And instead of trying to step on you
I let another nigga up on you

One that won't play no games and give it to you

Followin you round, talkin bout you breakin his heart
You too pretty, to have a nigga prettier than you
You need a cut-throat niggah, baby tell you the truth
I'm MJG and I ain't tryin to stay in your face
Or croud your space or try to get a key to your place
I got my own spot shit but we gon hit the hotel-e
I can't take you to my spot until I know that you ready
See I ain't the one to fall in love just in a week
Take out all my money then go invest in a freak

Don't worry bout the stress and the pressure he got you under

I'm not fine I'm not cute, they just know I got some loot
Grippin' wood, lookin' good, '24s make them choose
Nine times out of ten, the bitches bad news
Hit the dick and start actin' like a motherfuckin' fool
Clothes brand new from my T-shirt to my shoes
Pop a tag everyday that's what ghetto niggaz do
Hustle hard, spread all the bread with my crew
When we in the club they be poppin' bottles too
We crunk and keep it hype and everybody know it's on
When my work hits the street watch how quick that shit be gone
I rap like I'm quick enough but catch 'em full of zones
When my work hits the street watch how quick that shit be gone, nigga
Street niggaz, keep your guns, hit the traps
Spend your bread on rims and ice, whatever them bitches like
Street niggaz, push it all hard or ball
Sticky weed, whatever you need, man, we got it all
Street niggaz, keep your guns, hit the traps
Spend your bread on rims and ice, whatever them bitches like
Street niggaz, push it all hard or ball
Sticky weed, whatever you need, man, we got it all
I'm just a street nigga, I keep my heat under the seat
If a bum run up hope he got his gun up
From sundown to sunup I keep it with me
And I end up be unloadin' on y'all when y'all hit me
It's a grand shame that you niggaz come from it
But can't walk through it, what is it? I thought you knew it
It was the streets, nigga, my feet used to hit it
When I didn't have no wheels to go get it
MJ fuckin', G droppin' these bars with no regards
For snitches and fake broads
You ain't hard from steroids, nigga, you big fraud
I remember when them bullets was takin' your lunch card
I'm a real ghetto politician
And what I gotta give in to motherfuckers who willin' to try to vision
When a nigga spittin', quit all the whinin' and bitchin'
Baby sharp, look and listen, pay attention to what you been missin'
It's the street niggaz, keep your guns, hit the traps
Spend your bread on rims and ice, whatever them bitches like
Street niggaz, push it all hard or ball
Sticky weed, whatever you need, man, we got it all
Street niggaz, keep your guns, hit the traps
Spend your bread on rims and ice, whatever them bitches like
Street niggaz, push it all hard or ball
Sticky weed, whatever you need, man, we got it all
Yeah, c'mon, street niggaz, street niggaz
We sittin' on leathers and we grippin' on wood
(The streets is watchin')
C'mon, yeah, we makin' plenty bread and we reppin' our hood
(The streets is watchin')
Yeah, c'mon, money over bitches, man, it still all good
(The streets is watchin')
Street niggaz, street niggaz
We makin' plenty bread and we reppin' our hood
What can I say about these streets that I be walkin'?
Not too much 'cuz where I from niggaz ain't motherfuckin' talkin'
We'd rather listen and watch, tryin' to flex and guard
Their clothes and Baume and Mercier[Incomprehensible] watches
They gave my gloss on, I paid the cost to be the boss
On these corners where ballin' niggaz floss on
Haters get tossed on, 5-0 get [Incomprehensible]
And out of towners get robbed and drop that
Can't nobody gonna stop that
See, it was like this before me, so why am I [Incomprehensible]
If you think it's time to change, nigga, show me
Obviously you don't know me, it's time that you learned
Niggaz that try to hold me on my grind, they get burned
I'm down from P.A., man, west side to the east, fool
(C'mon Bun B, dude, what about peace?)
Fuck peace, fool
You want some love, ask your momma or the Lord
Bitch, I'm down with pimps see, UGK be goin' harder
[Incomprehensible] street niggaz, keep your guns, hit the traps
Spend your bread on rims and ice, whatever them bitches like

You might not know it but you
You gotta say it baby
The company you keep
It change daily baby
How did you get the Mercedes and the Escalade lately
How come its been trouble in the places you stayed lately
The black cat affair
A broken mirror
Two steps up under the ladder would bring me near her
To good luck that fucking with you
You make the sun rain
The same moment you left
Thats when the fun came
(Eightball)
Always bumping like a bad lady ho quit that
Straight up ask a nigga to pay when he wanna hit that
Always wanna drank my Hennessey
And smoke weed
Take you out to see a movie
Hoe please
If i ain't got to get a room i don't get one
I could hit you in the car and it'll be just as fun
There's six lil letters that describe you hoe
I could sing it much better baby this is how it goes
Chorus: Repeat 2x
The J the A the N the K the I the E
What that spell
Jankie (word up)
Bitch why you so jankie (word up)
(MJG)
Wussup sneaky nigga
How come you running yo mouth
And talking about bout some shit that really you don't even know bout
The way i see it you a slick instigata
You thank you low key but you steamin like hot potatoe
In the middle of the fuckin day in Jamaica
Chocolate strawberry or vanilla couldn't shake a
Jankie ass nigga like you
You built with fly paper
Leave shit around you and its gone good-bye later
(Eightball)
Always got your hand stuck out askin for shit
Instead of working you be begging trying to get rich quick
Faking acting like u interested just 2 hang around
Tell a nigga u a part of this and know u ain't down
U lying trying 2 hang tryin 2 pull u some hoes
Tellin them about the famous niggas that u know
U worst than the bitch u need 2 slow down dog
For niggas like you me and G made this song
Chrous (2x)
(MJG)
When you was six years old you was hit
Everytime they played the damn game and shit
(Eightball)
Wanna hang so everybody know your name and shit
U's a jankie mothafucka if I seen one trick
(MJG)
I seen one to
When lookin at you
You fit the definition
The height the body size yep the full description
(Eightball)
Please nigga get you head on straight and stop trippin
Gotta brag and stunt for you to get a little attention
(MJG)
Plus I mention you know you be frequently big cappin
And anything that a bitch want you give rapid
(Eightball)
Thats why hoes beg and broke and ain't shit
Gotta lay up under niggas and cook and suck dick
(MJG)
Not clean for a nigga and fix my truck bitch
But everythang that you do still ain't enough shit

This for niggas and hoes
This for all of those

Pimp hard, pimp harder
Pimp hard, pimp harder
Pimp hard, pimp harder
Pimp hard, pimp harder
Pimp hard, pimp harder
Big plush Cadillac seats holding me up
Bitches hatin' 'cuz I'm always doing big boy stuff
Would will ill be grippin' in my big boy truck?
Back then at the club gettin' this big boy sucked
8ball, MJG, you know we can't be touched
If it's 'bout Hennessey and weed you can link it to us
If I feel you disrespectin' I'ma cock it and bust
And MJG gon' be right with me if that eight ain't enough
If 8 ain't enough, don't worry, I got eight in the clip
Eight for them hard looks and eight for that lip
It was unnecessary that sort of punishment was
Less than very ugly which was fucked up
You wanted this you lucked up then
Oh well, some more shit I'm stuck up in
Hey, let's squash it, go sweep the dust up then
Drink a shot, I got a bitch you could drive a truck up in
MJG, pimp tight and I got 'em
Pimp hard, pimp harder
Pimp hard, pimp harder
Pimp hard, pimp harder
Pimp hard, pimp harder
Pimp hard, pimp harder
Pimp hard, pimp harder
Pimp hard, pimp harder
Pimp hard, pimp harder
We handle this shit like a pimp should
I fuck with them niggaz who run the hood
From the south to the east coast to the west
I be puffin' on that shit that gon' be burnin' in yo' chest
See them hoes want a nigga who got bread
These niggaz want a bitch you got that fire head
And all I want is weed and money and mo' money
The streets don't respect a nigga with no money
Ya poor dummy, you should be spendin' ya ho' money
When she offered you some, you probably tell her, ""No, honey""
You to slow sonny, what I'm spittin' gon' make you know somethin'
So the next time instead of just talking, you could show something
And most hoes is like casinos, pistol blow somethin'
So anytime a bitch approach me, I see some dope coming
My main focus is tricks who be out ho' huntin'
But they don't get that pussy for free, I make 'em owe somethin'
Pimp hard, pimp harder
Pimp hard, pimp harder
Pimp hard, pimp harder
Pimp hard, pimp harder
Pimp hard, pimp harder
Pimp hard, pimp harder
Pimp hard, pimp harder
Pimp hard, pimp harder
I like them yellow dick women giving love to me
Hugs and kisses disrespecting bitches 'cuz of me
Always wanna sex with me no matter where we be
All her friends do my friends and they do it for free
Okay, we smoke with them hoes and get em something to eat
But any real nigga will just to drill, baby
Pimp hard or pimp harder for the millennium
That paper out here for ya I'ma get me some
Hit a liquid some, tell my bitch to quick get the gun
We got some shit to run so shut up and cut off the grits they done
I want you up on your feet until they blitz the song
Bitch, you understand what I'm sayin'? I'm the official one
MJG, I pimp strong until the reasons gone
Until it ain't no ho' jack left to spring the season on
The niggaz who violated they still bleedin' on
I be packs and shit sacks and the leaving's on
Pimp hard, pimp harder
Pimp hard, pimp harder
Pimp hard, pimp harder

You can count on this pimpin', I got them Budweiser horse women
Black mack, make a rookie divorce pimpin'
I didn't read about it, I was born with it and exercised
First I came with a game plan (what) next I tried it
Now what you know about that money in her snatch
When she promised you that she was givin' you the whole stack
Can't be no lover slash pimp nigga, or a player slash good boy
You either be real or Mr. Goodjoy
Cause ain't no such thing as love at first sight
But it's a such thing that you was on them drugs the first night
It's mandatory for me to appeal to the women
Keep it real with the women, but let them tricks deal with the women
And when you in the field with them women
Watch 'em, they start talkin' love shit stop 'em
Cause ain't no hoe supposed to have no emotions
Her job is to keep a trick broken and hopeless
[Chorus - X2]
This is pimp shit, you hoes got to deal with
No nonsense, bitch, that's what this is
Pimp shit, you hoes gon' respect this
Real nigga shit and ain't scared to check a bitch
[Eightball]
I bust nuts on the face of slut hoes
And hang at the club with dope dealers and cutthroats
Never been one of them niggaz that would save a hoe
Bitch you know the score, you can get your shit and hit the door
Never slippin', you trippin' if you think you pimpin'
Hoes comin' up if they in front of you strippin'
Trickin', that pussy wet lookin' finger lickin'
Tradin' big faces hopin' you can stick your dick in
And she will do whatever for a dollar bill
Suck dick and lick clit on them X pills
High heels and big thighs make a dick ride
Make a nigga spend a grip and think of plenty lies
Lookin' deep in your eyes and don't mean none of it
I got the pie, you got to work if you want some of this
Where you from bitch, don't nothin' come easily
I got somethin' for you if you got somethin' for me
[Chorus - X2]
This is pimp shit, you hoes got to deal with
No nonsense, bitch, that's what this is
Pimp shit, you hoes gon' respect this
Real nigga shit and ain't scared to check a bitch
[MJG]
For four and a quarter you can get a hoe and a order
A Barbie doll bitch or a hoe from across the border
A loose bitch, a tight bitch, whatever you like
With the certain group of paint brushin' bitches consider priceless
Nut drinkers, butt spankers, dominatrix
Most ain't really with that rough shit but some can take it
One hundred percent born and bred, pimp type
Hoes make my money off of goin' to bed
[Eightball]
Givin' head, hookin' niggaz like a cigarette
Niggaz plea and pay fees, just to get a hit
Skin tight, with no hair so you can see the clit
White hoes, black hoes and hoes that Hispanic
Pierced tongue feel good when she workin' wood
Platinum Visa, PIN numbers and them check books
Turn it in, help a nigga get a new Benz
Turn out your friend, let me be both of y'all man
[Chorus - X3]
This is pimp shit, you hoes got to deal with
No nonsense, bitch, that's what this is
Pimp shit, you hoes gon' respect this
Real nigga shit and ain't scared to check a bitch"

intro,2005,eightball-mjg,Hip-Hop,"*Talking In The Background*
Uh
The streets of my city be gritty
Young niggaz pack plenty, and ain't never show no pity
Many die on streets of concrete, blasted from the heat
From under the seat, niggaz just tryin' to make ends meat
Trying to eat, day to day livin' with no religion
Luxury cars, and this money got my full attention
School teachers and the preachers don't know what to teach us
They don't get a second look without them ghetto features
Created so the non pigmentated rated
Pornographic caught they children learn the words and say it
Save the monsters, but don't nobody know the lord
Status depends on the baddest shit you can afford
And look at me I'm in the middle of the confusion
Crime in my blood and I need a transfusion
Take it how you want to take it
I gotta twist and break it
Make it shine to distinguish from the ones who fake it
and if it comes out raw, and uncontrollable
Money's foldable, fuck a hip-hop quoteable
Nobody felt what I was feeling when I wrote this shit
Broke this shit, but that ain't new so I can cope with this
Hope it get better for those who don't get a chance
To advance, and dig the shit I be saying
You know what might make what I say a little clearer
If mothafuckers judge the one they see in the mirror

Don't stop and relax them hoes

And a whole lot of pimpin' what a nigga be talkin' about
But when a bitch tell a nigga to spend some money
The mothafuckas still be walkin 'em out
Takin 'em home, givin 'em cheese, beggin 'em please
Talkin' about he'll take my ki's, big trick

Get your peeps up off my cheese
Put your money in the pot, go squeeze
See the bright red dice just die
Shoot a whole meal, I might just try
18 thou with the jewelery on the floor
When I hit a lick don't flex no more
Gamblin', scramblin' tryin' to get up out the hood
Nothin' but scavengers and the bettin' ain't good
Show me where it's sunny at, where it's funny at
Hoes with the polished toes, I'm a money cat
Tip toe blow walkin' on a rift raft
Put that shit back in ya pocket I don't sniff that
I'm lookin for the bud, and the brew
and some X with a broad with some thug in her jewels

Had to be something else to make them irate
Give a nigga a minute let me clean the slate

No, I ain't make threats on ya life

Eightball, the one you know from bustin' flows
Bout that real shit and bout these shady ass hoes
I hit the block when I was 12 and I ain't never leavin'
Kept a grip and kept on tippin' right through drought season
Never been a hater even at my lowest level
Some niggaz get some change and sell they soul to the Devil
I'm drinkin' Dom, man I'm chiefin' on some green sticky
Space Age Pimpin' and my real niggaz rollin' with me
Glocks and K's and Rugers with the rubber grip
Got 'Tel two-way transmittin' on my hip
Keep it real with them niggaz that be real with me
Orange Mile forever reppin' Memphis, Tennessee - MJG
[MJG]
Him and me, me and him, that's how we rolled
Over ten million records sold, Platinum and Gold
We broke the mold, ain't no duplicatin' the two
who makin' hit shit in clutch situations
and demonstratin' the real quality of a team which consists of
Eightball & MJG, we do this shit 'cause it feel good
First of all, we sacrificed for it
But afford it, then motherfuckers sheist for it
In the jungle of concrete just within one beat
of the heart you can be taken apart
Ain't no regret but scars from my battlin' hard tactics
I think I'll roll with the paper, you can keep the plastic
[Chorus]
I know you niggaz got doe
I saw you in them videos
I know you niggaz stay high
I saw you at the club right?
I know you niggaz keep hoes
I saw you with them freak hoes
I know you niggaz got it made
I saw you on the front page
[Eightball]
I've seen a lot of niggaz come and go
Saw some shit fall and seen a lot of shit grow
Money here, money gone like a magic trick
Real hustlers hustle with or without that shit
I get my grind on daily 'cause I wanna see
Me and my niggaz gettin' paid 'til we elderly
And it ain't hard if we all put that work in
Keep it twerkin 'til they close the fuckin' curtains
We all dream and we all have fantasies
Every nigga wanna buy that house for mama G
But life is like a roll of the dice, right
Sometimes you win and sometimes you just might
Lose it all, fucked up sick and don't know what to do
That's when you find out who really down to bust for you
I rock and roll from my heart and let my soul glow
And don't worry about what a nigga think he know, ya know?
[Chorus]
I know you niggaz got doe
I saw you in them videos
I know you niggaz stay high
I saw you at the club right?

Nothin' but 24/7 - 365
Eleven to eleven I be off in the fire
of this revolution, the solution is what I'm spittin'
Fat stacks of green backs is what I'm gettin'
Jaw bones and microphones, that's what I'm hittin'
I'm hangin' on the edge of the cliff with no mittens
Thick flickin', chrome smokin', preferred potion
Man will never touch my flow, deep as the ocean
When you go down too far and you - can't seem to light
Best to look out for that pressure baby, it bust pipes
I got too much fight - in my heart, body, my insight
is magnifyed a thousand times, more than the average guys
My status lies right before you with no disguise
The black mack is here to step up and so I rise
My shit has gone way past cold, it's freeze dry
One brain can't do what I do, you need five

I know you niggaz got doe
I saw you in them videos
I know you niggaz stay high
I saw you at the club right?

Ay dawg, check this out (uh)
Peep this..
I met this lil' chick the other day (yea)
Talkin 'bout some super stout
Super stout, she put it on ya boy
Yea I promise ya, she put it on ya boy
[Eightball]
It all started in the mall
She said ""Hey, ain't you Eightball?""
I said ""I'll be whoever you want me to be""
She was fine like a supermodel, Naomi
Out to the truck me and this ho bounced
Thirty minutes later we was on my couch
Remy, X.O. and green sticky weed
She hit it like a pro, didn't choke, didn't heave
We talked for a minute, you know how shit go
Two people get close and they jump off bro
I kissed her on the back of the neck, she got wild
Beggin me to hit it doggie style
Long story short, shorty got that fire
If I tricked off, I'd trick it on her
She said she got a man, but he ain't shit
He give her everythang but love and good dick
Time went on, we kept in contact right
But never really hooked up, and never got tight
I wish I coulda got with her one more time
Then maybe, I woulda never wrote this rhyme
[Hook - Eightball 2x]
She's always on my mind - I wanna be with her
She's always on my mind - But I can't be with her
She's always on my mind - I wanna be with her
She's always on my mind - But I can't be with her
[MJG]
She was 5'6, redbone and lye chick
Ain't no way she could disguise it
When her eyes hit, my eyes, it was a trance in it
Only thang that I was thinkin was in her pants
She was holdin my wood with a tight fist
I whispered, into her ear ""I know you like this""
She said ""I'm ridin wit'chu"" Damn right bitch!
I'm a pimp and I ain't got all night shit
I got a reserve ticket for a ho wanna kick it
Get down lick it, cuz I'm feelin you down wit it
She was certified, equipped with pussy grip
I ain't buyin a bitch a room, I'll fuck her off in my whip
Feel my rib-tipped, that triple bit Trojan
Fo' den hunnie, it's up in ho land
Up to the windowsill, knockin it off
Then I stuck it in your grill, I'll beat it up
Seein as how you, treated me - Knowin that I was pimpin
Before I understood what it meant, I broke women
MJG, breakin 'em in - mentally and physically
Mind, body, and money - shimmy shimmy
[Chorus 2x]
[MJG]
She was always right there, on the tip of my mind
Makin me look at other women blind
Every motherfuckin time I find myself lookin for a phone number
I'm gone, I'm alone, I want that women
When I see her, I'ma let her know how I feel about her
Be a pimp tight, real nigga with skills outta town
Lookin for the one that got me hypnotized
Hips and thighs, glimpsin eyes, trippin now
Go'on the same, ready to knock it off friend
When she admit it's time, I'm lock it in
Head straight to the hood, and snatch a six-pack
Tell the folks that I'm with, that I'ma get back
I think her name was uhh.. shit I can't remember
But I know she was a cute, lil', stout tender
Ready to put it down, whether rain or shine
She always, always, always..
[Chorus 4x]
[MJG whispering 4x]
She's always on my mind.. always on my mind
She's always on my mind.. always on my mind

Hold it down, get it right, keep it tight
And most of all..

For my three sons, for my mom
For waking me up and breathing air into my lungs
For health and wealth and lots of love for myself
The chances in life to take the right steps
I done popped that thang, and I done been popped at
Stole, cheated, and lied
Survived when I could have died
Or somewhere locked up, my niggas locked up
That's why I pray to you, say what I say to you
Thank you for Swizz Beatz, to him you bring the heat
He brought the heat to us, we burn the streets up
Thank you for family and everyone that stuck with us
Gettin it crunk, and layin it down, and gettin to buck with us
Thank you for not lettin material things make me
Thank you for givin me the talent that my peoples see
Thank you for lettin my niggas live after gunplay
Thanks for forgiving me, cuz I don't do this every day

I thank God for havin a mother and a father
To rely on for guidance when circumstances got harder
I'm a part of a whole race who thank God
For being able to be free and leave the plantation yard
And, I thank God for givin me the understandin to acknowledge him
Notice his footsteps and follow him
I'm walkin today, I'm talkin today
I'm feelin today, but on top of that I'm livin today
And, I thank God because he gave his only child
Would you give your only child? Think about that for awhile
And, I thank God for givin me my baby daughter
A roof over her head, and fresh clean drinkin water
And, I thank God for not being afraid to love
So all the love I give, I get back major love
And, I thank God for givin me all the blessings
To put a little piece of what we all think into this message
[Chorus w/ MJG instead of Eightball]
[MJG]
For all the times I thought I was in the worst situation
that I could be in
God helped me see in, them cloudy times
Them, ""I wanna get rowdy"" times
One of them, ""They tried to bring the devil out of me"" times
I thank God, for keepin my mind solid
And I respect my elders, if or if not they went to college
And, thank you Lord, for makin my bin and I swored
And I'm glad I don't feel like I have to kill to pay the bill
[Eightball]
I was blessed to be a story teller, CD seller
My niggas be them shady fellas, chasin yella
Greedy with they eyes beady, lives easy
Dispise those who rise easy, talkin freely
Thank you for them tricks who be, talkin down
Hatin me and think that I don't, get around
The rumors and the talkin all it do is bore me
Trick I done been through a true Holly-wood story

Yea, Eightball, MJG

This for all my G's and my niggas that ride with me
Only God feel the pain and only he can really see
Through the eyes of a child
A baby born wild
Gangsta shit flow through his blood and no one had to show him how
Kill or be killed where I come from ain't no in between
Why trade the world just to be a dope fiend
Hoes have a child just to take a nigga change
Twelve years later he want to know his daddy name
Maximum security prison how we get to see
The only man resemble him and this shit here ain't on T.V.
Your favorite actor don't play this part
If you never live to sit you can't say his heart

Unless you want to believe me (believe me)

So precious and innocent to the world
Get swallowed up and sucked up by this world

Gettin' high and sellin' ya soul who can you blame
Nigga love you what do they love what you do
It's aiight boo I know you gotta get paid too
It's a long road
Full of ?? niggas and hoes
Gotta be strong
Cuz It's so easy for you to be gone
Not here no more
You not breathing so yo not here no more
You touch no more
You feel no more and you don't fear no more
Not here no more
I know you don't want to hear dis
But somebody got to tell ya some real shit
Not sugarcoated
Cuz where I come from shit ain't sweet
You got a choice and it ain't shit for you in them streets
Black women be a momma to ya little babies
Get on ya knees and pray to God things change daily
[Chorus x2]

We ain't tryin to preach to ya
Just tryin' to reach to ya
See all of us are blessed with somethin'
But most of us don't take two seconds out of our days
to try to imagine somebosy elses hard times
Because ya too busy worried about cha own
If ya wanna know what real is
Real is experiencing good times and hardaches and being
able to balance them boats
But at the same time realizing that the world will continue to
spin with or without you
Lend me your ears, give me your spirit your conscience has to pay
attention to what I mention
I'm your eye opener the hope for the one to will never see the suburbs
And if good life is only the word
The phrase the life that somebody else is living
Although we human most of us continue to live in
In humane, dormanes whether pictures the same
Children being born using their mothers maiden name
We play the game of life but we don't all win
Most of us ride the bench until were called in
Struggling to get noticed in the side the one-sided
On nation under God so divided
Out of touch with each others cultural activities
If you don't know someone like me than how you feelin' me
MJG, the air we breathe makes us all related
So suck it up and realize it takes us all to make it

Stop it there without a care to what you've got to fear
Keep it all between your beer and your hockey hair
A lot of weird people traits and ticks
From the strangers to these dangerous faces you kiss
You know this town ain't cool as it used to be
When the lions, tigers and bears'd stare at your jewelry
Thruthfully I'm content with how the day moves
Stepped up the game, oops, still rock the same shoes
And one-time with them flashin things, they still
There to turn the drama into action scenes
I'm renting me a vehicle to roll me to the finish line
Follow if you wanna, we'll return around dinner time
Back hurts a little bit more with every cigarette
My mack learned to never ignore the petty gibberish
I like to play cocky like MR. Know-It-Also
So patiently waiting to pop! shake up the soda bottle
Horizontal like a mail-order male whore that came forth
Just to show you his pale horse
Of course the ones that love him hate him most
Heard broken aint nothin man, she look like she ate a ghost
Make a toast to the butterknife, fuck it right
Wonder when my butterfly is gonna keep her flutter tight
I get way lonely when I'm on the j-o-b
And every pretty face actin like they know me
Same story, take photos and blow me
Like suckin on my pony is some type of a fuckin trophy
Don't know what to say homie, I understand under
the notion that mine is at home under another man
Don't even give it two minutes of business
Rotate the shoulderblades try to keep them chipless
Built a prison out of conjugal visits
Now I rock a fake grimace on my face to catch the kisses
A bag of pot luck, a pint of gut rot
emcee's is mockduck tofu tough-talk
Witht the blood clot, jumpshot, fadeaway
Watch these kids eat it up like it was mayonaisse
Then he's on to the next city followin the destiny
Fell asleep droolin on your left titty
Indeed I play my part and call it high art
Keepin my eye on a piece of that pie chart
Smarter than solutions to the rubix cube
Took it apart and then pulled out a tube of superglue
Electric boogaloo, instead of tryin to look at you
I should stay in my house, sit on the couch and read a book or two
Maybe then this space alien can uncover ways to coexist
With other homosapiens
Until that time comes people know my bum steelo
Incognito with mosquitos and dung beetles
It's like that, never the wack a natural fact
It's like this St. Paul Minneapolis Jack
It's like that, take your head out of the vaginal crack
Like what the fuck did you expect

Who they play when the game's in a tight spot?

I must be getting old cause the bass sounds ridiculous
And nowadays, every body's biting Tupac
So fuck it, I'ma stand over here and do the moonwalk
Besides police, I've got no beef
Just me, my beliefs and my bad teeth
A cargo van and some Ant beets
Enough rap to slap you to last week
Caught between the vice and the advice
Drunk, walking out in traffic just to fly kites
Time out, the free-style rhyme out, my last rights
Fuck a classic album, give my life 5 mics
And when the smoke clears, you won't be able to suck dick
Like you did as a teenage slut trick
And with a mat on his grill, he asks ""Who the fuck are you?""

So I ripped up the Kangol and threw it away
I stole moves from KRS-One
A little Big Daddy Cane and some DJ Run
And then we took our life and made it a song

For what? I don't know, but who wanna come with me?
I got at least one more tool with me
So criticize me, or idolize me
Study from a distance or stand right beside me
It don't matter, just act like I know

The question was raised to me the other day
why I seem to always have joy.
Well I'd like to take time to set the record straight.
All the joy I've ever known has disappeared...
(Brother Ali)
Uh, into motherfuckin' thin air.
Like it's never even been there.
My joy done left me y'all.
Shit I never hang my head man.
CHORUS
And God's rain water flow through the same gutter
that we walk today, gotta stay brave brotha.
Keep you your lip stiff, keep your fist clenched.
At times you gotta kick your way through this bitch.
Verse 1
And I can't stop feelin' guilty smilin'.
A wise man once told me that every cloud has a silver linin'.
I wanted to believe him but its a trick to find em'
when the people around me continue dyin'.
Grandad was in the twilight of his life
when he closed his eyes tight and opened his wrists wide.
What make a tenth round fighter with a winning score
decide he need to throw the towel before the whistle blow?
Maybe I'll never know, but I inherited his poetic soul
so the sybolism's yet to show.
Is life so obscene that death's more serine?
Or was an old auther trying to write his own closing scene?
Nothin stings like knowin that the woman who gave me this life is being eaten from the inside.
I thought we'd never make shit right.
I wish I'd have viewed it once clear
before you were done here.
That's two in one year that I let leave here,
lovin' me, without shedding one single tear.
Either I'm one of the strongest people left
or ya'll should stone me for even trying to steal breath.
CHORUS X2
Verse 2
They say ""Shit, scrapper, you all by yourself ain't ya?""
Damn straight, I got a jail cell nature.
Been boxed up but I've never been settled in.
Then got tough, started developing leather skin.
I learned to make that face that tells predators
it's better to reassess just who you bout to wrestle with.
I'm on one like the first kick drum of the beat.
Clear my lungs, spit blood on the street.
They tellin me we got nothing to fear but fear itself
but I fear I have no human fear left.
Someday I'm gonna wanna peel back these calluses
and really feel life again and that where my challenge is.
I've been kickin and bitin for so long
that when they throw me a rescue rope I'll be too weary to hold on
and see the light. So I sing through the tears
in the key of life, the way a wounded ego might.
Chorus X2
BRIDGE
My joy done left me ya'll.
She don't show her face around these parts.
Every time she come she gets chased off,
so she stays distant.
Verse 3
If it weren't for me squintin he wouldn't know the sun was out.
I hate every word that come out of his fuckin mouth.
Ladies treat him special, don't know nothin bout him.
If they saw what his wife see they wouldn't fuss about him.
He can't do shit right but rap and make babies
and babies need daddy at home consistent,
but rap keep daddy on the road religious.
So even in my two loves my soul is so conflicted.
My son came into this world innocent
and he deserves everything that needs to live in it.
And this home I made for him is broken,
I'm hopin his love for me will never grow thin.
It hurts daddy to know and to know when
you were cryin at the hospital I'm out tryin to rock a show.
I made a vow that we'd never be broke again
and I'd never be a burden on another friend.
So when I've sweated on my farewell stage,
when I've wrote my last hook in my last rhyme book,
when I get the last nod of approval from my family,
this is the man I have to be.
Chorus X4
Sometimes I feel like I'm almost gone. You ever felt that way?"

Man, I'm telling you some motherfuckers just have no kind of heart, man.
Serious man , motherfuckers man, these motherfuckers man, these motherfuckers have no self respect.

Just some small scale davilin confined to the basement
Never knew I'd grow to this full time user
Never figured that I was a winner or a loser only did the due to have fun
And only got with a crew because it seemed natural to have one
Capture the life in the form of the grip around the mic hold it
Right like a love hold it tight with plight fortifies my
Existence reinforces my position in this course that I'm sticking to my path now
I can see it all laid out in my past while trying to catch what it's about in my last breath

Now, I'm about to put a (Slug) in
Show business and if everything goes right, I'm leaving no witness
I hold this inside the chest, so big it hardly fits it trips between a true fan of party
Shits quit to lace the track with substance for all the young guns that's really listening
At the functions so you can love it or leave it, fuck it or keep it, either way
I'll be here trudging through the deep shit
I've done well over hundred cuts and gotten the feed back of love
From some of the ones I've touched and thus, I'm not quitting never stop rippin' you gotta be kiddin' shit
He's on a mission is it possible the mics got my soul?
I'll make them all say ""Ho!"" and Rhymesayers
Rock the show let 'em know that it's more then a career goal
Cut that zero and let the hero in your ear hole, yo!

I don't believe you should hold a mic and rolled up with a bus full of friend that think alike
I'm having a hard time trying to keep it simple just for the fuckers that don't seem to read between the ripples
It's all nipples and clits in this rap shit, catch a licking if you lay back passive bastard
It's like that y'all, it's like that y'all, art imitates life than most of it it's wack y'all

With the excitment of a new born
Came to join the main event and fight against the luke warm
With nothing but they word and they history
Take a can of paint and try to decorate their dignity
It's not what they anticipated
But, fuck, it doesn't matter. Put your fists up and instigate it
And they can't save the planet
Or the children or the bandits
Or themselves god damn it
I'm just a man that loved rap
So much in fact
I put every piece of myself inside these fucking tracks
What is that, you whisper something from the back?
You think your personal attacks
Make up for what you lack?
I'm just a cat searching for a clean lap
To crash in a world hurting, waiting for they turn to take a nap
Sorting through bills, fan mail and life threats
Wonderin why the postman ain't delivered my wife yet

So I smile while I try to use my words wise
Say what I meant just in case this is your first time
Via? child of the wings tired
Smilin' like a couple of fools that the queen hired
Can't wait for the vibrate to thicken
So we can watch the world tip side. WAIT!
Even the deads gettin live
It's a little deeper, you can float, come on baby dive!
To fall in love with this bitch
From the petals on her flower to the pimples on her tits
Fuck the insults. And fuck the compliments
Just wanna see the mommy free the honesty and common sense
Stop followin the win that you swallow
Cause it's too simple to aim for a target sittin on a fence
We do it for the candle in the sky
Here's a toast goes out to those who can't handle their high
You and I, we can swim into the tide
And watch these other children lose they mind
(I'm growing tired!)
(they've arrived)
And they landed safe and sound
Better try to take 'em out before they make ya saviors proud
So fix your beef, quit actin' like a sheep
Either spit your speak or sit there and git your teeth
To spread the info to the kin folk
Fuckin with the climate on the inside of the windows
They're here, the baby farmers gonna take it farther
Make a mark and break apart your fake martyrs
planted firm, let the planet burn
Understand the terms, you don't wanna open up this can of worms
I'm tryin to keep my prize on the eyeball
But people wanna see you fly all to watch the sky fall
Who's to blame for your lack of conviction
I wasn't drafted, I asked for the mission
Put your name on the list at the bottom on an empty line
And hope in plain sight for what ever gave you the right to question mine
The night prowler, gonna crawl past all the rap politics
You can put that on your last dollar
Wake up, it's bigger than a pay stub
There's the door, get cho money, go wash off your make-up
(they arrived)
[Muffled]
And they don't need your lovin
If you don't wanna give it, keep it
Doesn't really mean nothin'
gonna beat it 'til it stops breathin'
No need to even try to reason with em they're not leavin'"

Tomorrow's forecast: flurries motherfucker!
(..Snowman in full effect)
Snowman in full effect so play the odds out 'till April
The tapes will grow so we can buy posters and staples
I bet that kid Slug will bust flows, if you ask nice
It's Friday night, point me to the party wanna grab mics
Used to get queezy when it was time to rock that B.B.
But nowadays I'm just trying to get Musab away from the TV
Cause I can't fuck with the Zenith, I rather criticize Tuesdays releases
with the elitists at the fetus
Yet, another factory film is what we present
Surrounding, bitch needed a ballpoint, no grievance
Let's all point our fingers towards the path we venture
Minneapolis natives taken the rap of winter bad contender
Let me catch a lukewarm triple mocha to reach the speed
of the ?cat? that scratched on my sofa
And in the green room is emcees and in the kitchen is dirty dishes
And my position: blurry vision
And I'm livin' in a section where heads is frozen stiff
And these skinny powdered sniffin' kids is posin' talkin' shit
Since the first time I met you backstage in the name room
I knew that I did not want to occupy the same room
I drive for a living, but I take the bus to work
Auditioned for the role of Jesus, got the part of ""Jerk""
Armed with a walkman and a fake grin and a basement mindstate when I--
[Slug]
Simply took a left at Nicollet
Sucking on a cigarette did some pinch hits before I left
And now the nicotine is liftin' it
Choke at the last drag and flick remains at the gutter
Flip up the hood just to keep the brains covered
I'm trying to grow a mountain out of a foothill
I see people rockin' my t-shirt, and I'm still shopping at Goodwill
In a struggle, in a warzone, grew some extra personality
Now I won't have to flee or fight alone
The microphone: that's my weapon and I'm on a quest for Heaven
Or rent me some comprehension
It's busy as fuck, just gimme a three hour lead (Hour lead)
So I can reflect maybe rent a flick and re-learn how to read
The weed turn out the sleeves and found a bunch of tricks
and used a cleaver to relieve all these unnecessary limbs
Misplaced the gems and jewels I meant to give you
To lift you, and lost my mind inside the issue
And now I live it in a section where heads is frozen stiff
And these skinny powdered sniffin' kids is posin' talkin' shit
Since the first time I met you backstage in the name room
I knew that I did not want to occupy the same room
I drive for a living, but I take the bus to work
Auditioned for the roll of Jesus, got the part of ""Jerk""
Armed with a walkman and a fake grin and a basement mindstate when I think--
[Slug]
Now, I got spies positioned at various chivos around the city
Lots of people that's down with me cause the evils out to get me
It's easy to decipher who can taste me
A lot of locals used to hate me, but now I think the tolerate me
You can only hear what I feel when my eyes are shut
Mistakes are piling up, excuses: they lining up
I'm trying to fuck reality, but I'm impotent I can't get it up
Cause she's a duck and her personality sucks just my luck
I caught the wrong bus guess I'll get off at the crossroads
And take a long lunch
Next month when I got my head right I'mma grab a lead pipe
And beat some life into this dead mic
So let the tape roll and extract all the juices
Read the hate mail in the bathroom and place wages on the losers
In the beginning, you can't help but wanna be innovative
But eventually the opposition leaves you jaded
Like hell no (Hell no), I don't wish I was a baller
I'm six foot three, there ain't no need for me to be any taller
I just wish those cats over there at Fobia would hit me off with some free gear or somethin'
..Come on
Cause I'm livin' in a section where heads is frozen stiff
And these skinny powdered sniffin' kids is posin' talkin' shit
Since the first time I met you backstage in the name room
I knew that I did not want to occupy the same room
I drive for a living but I take the bus to work
Auditioned for the role of Jesus, got the part of ""Jerk""
Armed with a walkman and a fake grin and a basement mindstate when I
think of how simple it could all be
[Slug]

advanced-communications,2005,atmosphere,Hip-Hop,"yo homie
had I known you would of grown
to a full blown example of how to act like an asshole
I never would have introduced you to booze and skipping school
cause right now I feel responsible to find an antidote
back in junior high when you and I started getting high
life was just a joke, we was to young to know the punch line
and you were sooner die, then realize your running out of time
who is to decide there is no more recess after lunchtime
bam here you am, intoxicated again, yo how you doing man, yeah its good to see you
Bam here you am, intoxicated again, you used to be my man, understand
I believe you slightly succeeded, how many of them drink that you think you need
when you are trying to boost the bonus points and reinforce your voice
but im not trying to walk within your obnoxiousness
we used to be friends back in the day when you had direction
but that was before your brain felt that infection
I aint claiming innocence, I was right there with you then
but im just saying, when we was waiting to move up some of us grew up
we all knew what the difference between what wrong and right was
sometimes the line blurred
when we was influenced by a light buzz
but from what I see
you've established the persona basis
built the foundation for emulating the genera, drama
without taking the moments upon the trail of karma
that's peeved through the field that you wandered
no longer am I shocked, by the things you do
I'm just confused as to why it has to be me to confront you
I guess nobody else gives a damn
so I got to go up myself, cause I am a man
understand
you can take it as concern, or you can see it as your ego getting burned
either way tonight though, one us is going to learn
and I guess nobody else gives a damn, but see I do, cause you used to be my man, understand
even if you beat me down to the cement, its all love
I need to see you stick around until the end
Bam intoxicated again right (got to go up myself)
Bam cause I am a man understand"
dungeons-and-dragons,2005,atmosphere,Hip-Hop,"??Dungeons and DragonsÃ¢?? by Dr. Demento
Narrator: Dungeons and Dragons, Satan's game. Your children like it or not, are attracted in their weaker years to the Occult and a game like D+D fuels their imagination and makes them feel special, while drawing them deeper and deeper into the bowels of El Diablo. This afternoon the Dead Alewives watch tower invites you to sit in on an actual gaming session. Observe the previously unobservable as a hidden camera takes you to the inner sanctum of Dungeons and Dragons
Graham: Galstaff you have entered the door to the north. You are now by yourself standing in a dark room, the pungent stench of mildew emanates off the wet dungeon walls.
Nightblade: Where are the Cheetos!
Graham: They're right next to you.
Galstaff: I cast a spell.
Nightblade: Where's the Mountain Dew!
Graham: In the Fridge. DUH!
Galstaff: I wanna cast a spell.
Nightblade: Can I have a Mountain Dew!
Graham: Yes, you can have a Mountain Dew just go get it.
Galstaff: I can cast any of these right, on the list?
Graham: Yes, any any of the first level ones.
Nightblade: I'm gonna get a soda, any one want one? Hey Graham I'm not in the room right?
Graham: What room?
Galstaff: I wanna cast magic missile.
Nightblade: The room where he's casting all these spells from!
Graham: He hasn't cast any thing yet.
Galstaff: I am though if you'd listen. I'm casting Magic Missile.
Graham: Why are you casting Magic Missile, there's nothing to attack here.
Galstaff: I- I- I'm attacking the darkness.
(laughing)
Graham: Fine fine you attack the darkness there's an elf in front of you.
Picard: Whoa! That's me right?
Graham: He's wearing a brown tunic and he has gray hair and blue eyes.
Picard: No I don't, I have gray eyes.
Graham: Let me see that sheet.
Picard: Well it says I have, well it says I have blue but I decided I wanted gray eyes.
Graham: Whatever, ok, you guys can talk now if you want.
Galstaff: Hello.
Picard: Hello.
Galstaff: I am Galstaff, Sorcerer of Light.
Picard: Then how come you had to cast Magic Missile?
(laughing)
Graham: why- why- why- You guys are being attacked.
Nightblade: Do I see that happening!?!
Graham: NO! You're outside by the tavern.
Nightblade: Cool, I get drunk!
Graham: Ugh. There are there are seven ogres surrounding you.
Picard: How can they surround us? I had Mordenkainens Magical Watch Dog cast!
Graham: No you didn't.
Nightblade: I'm getting drunk! Are there any girls there?
Picard: I totally did. You asked me if I wanted any equipment before this adventure, and I said no, but I need material components for all my spells, so I cast Mordenkainens Faithful Watch Dog.
Graham: But you never actually cast it.
Nightblade: Roll the dice to see if I'm getting drunk!
Graham: Ugh. Yeah you are.
Nightblade: Are there any girls there?
Graham: Yeah!
Picard: I did though; I completely said when you asked me...
Graham: No you didn't. You didn't actually say that you were casting the spell so now there's ogres. Ok.
Nightblade: OGRES!?! Man, I got an ogre slaying knife! It's got a +9 against ogres!
Graham: You're not there, you're getting DRUNK!
Nightblade: Ok, but if there's any girls there I wanna do them!
Narrator: There you have it. A frightening look into Americas most frightening past time. Remember that it's not you children's fault that's their being drawn into a satanic world of nightmare. It's their gym teachers fault for making them feel out cast when they couldn't do one single pull up."
the-abusing-of-the-rib,2005,atmosphere,Hip-Hop,"Atmosphere - Abusing The Rib Lyrics
i wanna follow the footprints across my lovers stomach
i wanna call out her name before i plummet
i wish i had a map of the terrain
so i could step around the landmines
avoid the beasts under the bed
that breathe at bad times
i wanna find these here so-called treasures
the pleasures the trinkets the never-ending weekends
acknowledging that i'm still just a piece of the sequence
but seein these different footprints got me needin to show my
WEAKNESS
TIMELINES, timezones
i cross em with my eyes closed
memorize the landmarks and learn the cycles
the weather patterns
how the seasons affect
the east and the west
of each region learn the cycles
forget about the fact that
many trails have been tracked
maybe it's a plus that there's a path
if this was some uncharted land
i'd have to be a smarter man
willing to travel the farthest
to unravel the harvest
and natural resources are unlimited
exploration only required some desire and INITIATIVE
take your time to find the right way to climb
it ain't safe to play games with natures mind
if i
could show you
you would
never
leave it
i wanna ride a train
up my lovers arm
stop off at the brain
to hop out and find out whats goin on
cut through trees
and ride through rocks
synchronize the universal sundial to my watch
i've seen a lot
but not quite as much as her
to top it off the memory and the imagination blur
but i know she's been put through hell
i can feel it
and i know she's touched heaven as well
tryin to steal it
it came on and it taught her a song
IT strung her along
and it caught her when her guard was gone
now to the break of dawn
she's tryin to fill what fits
and all her family and friends is tryin to seal them lips
but i ain't dumb
i can HEAR that train come from miles away
settin obstacles to stop the arrival
i'm gonna blow up that iron and wood road
from what i understood those
be the ORIFICE of its survival
my recital
another tantrum
because she's highly excitable
swinging a random
no happy endings always off to a bad start
addictive
VOYEURISTIC to the trackmarts
and if i
could show you
you would
never
leave it"

Yo we travel like the wind across the rotten fruited plain
We travel like the blood that surrounds your brain
Atmosphere has landed, demandin that we raise the curve
Expand the kingdom, all heads of the earth
[Slug]
Once in a great while one has the heart to approach us
But usually comes up close, he didn't know who it was
The name travels further than the face
He did not recognize the profile
Only saw an mc for him to waste but no child, that ain't the case
Go find yourself a cause
I take advantage of your flawsand climb into yo drawers
Now didit damage your jaws
When it dropped and hit the pavement
It shot, thats why they keep me locked
Underneath the basement alot
Letting me out jus to eat and shit
And ever so often jus to keep me fit
They gimme a new mc to rip to pieces
Grip their neck, release is out of the question
Maybe theyll let me out if I make a good impression
So please don't make it personal when I flush me through your vains
Consider youself a big part of that great mc food chain
And take your spot in the circle with pride
Reps die, with dignity if you let em
And when they do, I respect them, welcome
The cure for your suffering, tell them it's pure
No subtle hints of weak substances cuttin it
I chuckle when evil and pride collide with judgement
Add that to your buzz and the results is malfunction
No longer should I listen to your babble
Too many coming off the deep end
Where it's steady, stream, and shallow
I have no remorse for those that drop some, they all drop
Until then Imma stay on top of heads like a bald spot
[Chorus]
We travel like the wind across the rotten fruited plain
We travel like the blood that surrounds your brain
Atmosphere has landed, demandin that we raise the curve
So unravel your thoughts and come across in a verse

Yo I sold my car to the junk yard, couldnt fuck with the insurance
Gave me forty bucks, bought a bus card and lunch at bergins
For fun I drain the essence from life forms of messes
Deal with daily stresses, and keep my mic warm with message
Ive learned how to hack my keys in the matter of arrogance and confidence
Contributing to my ego trips and accomplishments
Hes on some shit, no not yet, I'm jus follow my path
I don't eat my words as often as I swallow my laugh
Apollo is back, landed on the 4-shay, and everythings okay
According to commercials for the lowback yoplay
And I know that theres no way to say what you need to hear
So I take the long way to your brain and put some flavor in your ear
Like using a clever on cantalope, leave your plans at hope
On the shoudler with the road-kill carcasses for those skilled smart-asses
Atmosphere coming clear to the ?runway to entertain?
?blast the bag? and scoop up all the brains"

The following program contains explicit lyrics
and we the producers stay defiantly behind the views expressed in the following program.
All right, all you players and player haters, once again it's time for the ""Sep Sev"" game show
Recorded live right here in lovely snowy Minnesota
this is the game where we make the average player a star.
Now, if you'll join me, let's give it up for the host of the ""Sep Sev"" game show
that's right, here he is, Mr. Sep Sev...
YO, YO, YO, YO, YO, YO, fuck the money, everyone on the floor drop
I want all the food in the bag, and I ain't tryin' to hear that soar talk
Stole the dinner and freaked it to the freeway
Flipped the screenplay, and made every love scene a three-way
Sound track recorded here in Minnesnowda
Tastes like ambrosia
Disinfects pen holders
Yo, let's hold our breath and show your chest, if you're proud of it
And wake me back to safety if you see me falling out of it
Under a full moon, the color ?of mind is a mucous?
See your in the distance, the images riveting
Given the way the clouds moved, it fucked with the lighting
Grabbed me by the thoughts and pulled me tight like a kite string
All right, let's hear it for contestant number one
What's your name sir?
Yo, MC famous, the killer
Okay Mr. Anus Driller, you want to play the next round for a new Lexus with matching socks?
Or air on the horny Miami based video
or do you just want to take the phony looking fifty dollar bills and run with money?
Yo, I want the sex man, just give chicks man, just, just let me touch 'em man!
[Slug]
Now what If I spent, my whole day ?, on getting bent, and now I can't afford my rent
Do I grab a crowbar to your back door (Back door)
or hit up Super America for the cash drawer? (Fast forward)
I should be honest, cause even my outer conscience,
Knows the odds of blowing up are equal to people waking up from sleeping,
Keeping me from retrieving kingdoms and bed time stories,
Used to bore me with, positioned in the orbit of my imagination
Small portion, even that much, flustered by the drug fell in lust with the rush
Hush, maybe somewhere in it I became a cynic,
but your sexy grin gets less attractive by the minute
The planets in my head now rotate around the mind
The substance, the bug shit, all in my circumference
And I function
Like I don't give a fuck if you grasp it
Resent the bitch that don't and cast it under the masses;
I asked, ""Is that right?"" I answered, ""Does it matter?""
I was glancing at how you fancy the passion, bastard
How fast you scale the ladder to jump
I'd rather just flunk than gather your junk
(Yo dog, you should blast that punk)
Alright, this next round our contestant is gonna have to slam
a whole bottle of expensive firewater, chase it with a forty of malt liquor
smoke a blunt, load a gun and sell records to 14 year olds all over the country
And the first one of you genocidal fashion fantasy fucks to go platinum wins
Wins what!?
Mr. Announcer, tell them what they'll win!
Well, they'll win respect, lot's and lot's of props!
[Slug]
Pissed on the Asti Spumonte, sippin' kamekazi
Shoulda called mommy when you saw me pull up in ?
The rest of you're life's a flashback when I jump out that hatchback
Here's your tape, give me my cash back
I'm on tracks, and that's that, in fact that's all you need
Either take some kind of lead, or fall to your knees and bleed
How's your scene?
And how's that rental running?
And how's the weed selling?
And how's the demo coming?
Me and my participants, be the reason why you and you crew bit your lips
Stick this in your mouth to cleanse it
The fuckin' prop is too expensive
Make's me want to end it (Repent kid)
My advice is from here on out you purchase yellow boxers
That way when your bitch does your laundry, she won't tell her moms about the stains created
when I skated across that flat service you refer to as lyrical endowment
That content, that conscience, run down to that ?"

Suzy was a psycho, but she looked good
Little ball of fire, light it up and cook wood
She knew the power of what she had to offer
Pieces of a puzzle, personality, and posture
When it's probably done, it seems spun
As long as you're not ??
Bar fly looking for a fall guy
Taking on all types
From big baller to the small fry
Get what you want out of life
But every night now the same thought arise (babe you got a light?)
Still as lonely as the number one
Cause you only love someone
So you have someone to run from
Run, run, put your back into it Sue
Always wonder what it would be like to try to rap to you
We gotta show Suzy love
Ain't no way anyone's gonna stop before the music does

Bobby was a genius, and he would prove it
His favorite move is to make you look stupid
He knows the answer, nobody puts their hands up
When he starts talking everybody (shut up)
Bobby didn't have friends, not real ones
Just a bunch of light minded self righteous pilgrims
And they all treated Bob like the big cheese
Knowing damn well they all thought he was a ""bitch please""
Blows his own horn, slaps his own bass
While everyone waits for him to fall on his face
And while he's down, someone will take his place
If the suit isn't trump even seven beats an ace
Look at Bobby, he doesn't even know
You're supposed to set a new one after you achieve a goal
Accomplishments are just excuses to talk and spit
When you music stops, who will have a spot to sit?
[Chorus 4X]
Bring me the head of whoever said ""play fair""
I want to sit in my chair and wear a blank stare
Fuck being king of the hill
When the music dies you'll be the first one the villagers kill
Walk in circles, dizzy up the movement
Talk in circles, the underground's polluted
Lots of circles, you wonderin' where you fit
Stop the cirlces!

And when I fall flat I'll smile

Yo step with stride i got this pet named pride
and i'ma-hide him in my pocket til the day that i die

and when he's old enough i will set him free and let him breed,
teach his kids how to build bombs and shoot speed.

she aint happy when i'm around, she's mad when i'm gone.
so i'ma drink this pint of whiskey and go pass out on the lawn
and when she leaves to go to work she'll find me in my stuper,
Start my day off with an angel, wreck her morning with a loser.
i'm true to the game, don't know the rules to the game.
ruin my shoes stompin through puddles and pools in my brain
i can remove my heart to shave my legs
but no matter how soft i walk i still manage to break some eggs????????

panic-attack-the-p-a,2005,atmosphere,Hip-Hop,"Little momma got a little pill to swallow
A little water to follow it down the tunnel
Gotta lotta walls but the house is hollow
Got a lot of holes, never found the shovel
Panic attack, so what's the plan of attack?
You had to be had. You cut in half. You had to react
You battle with your shadow from front to back
Stack up the stats. Handle the math, and that'll be that
Hold your head up. I know your fed up
But don't let it get up to the top of them steps love
Instead of playin' with the pieces that got messed up
get dressed up, we goin' out to catch the best buzz
Self-medicated, spirit on elevated
Help take the self-made self-hate and celebrate it
And I could tell you hated it when you felt naked
but the poison tastes great, wanna know how the hell they made it?
And if the dizzy don't kill you, the city will
Simply for the thrill of wiping up a sticky spill
Little tricky get busy of a fifty bill
So take the little pill straight to your pretty grill
[Chorus]
Here it comes, there it goes again. Panic attack. [x8]
So what you drinking? So what you popping?
So what you eating? So what you dropping?
So what you smoking? So what you sniffing?
So how you coping? So what's the difference?
Contagious, it runs like the paint does
Sedate the sober and over anxious
The pages of pain that make the songs on the playlist
The renegade rain that jumped just to flood the bassment
Look honey everbody needs a help-up buddy
No body's drug-free, the streets would be hella bloody
Do you call yourself a patient of a junky?
The only thing that separates is who takes your money
All smile like we're gonna go buck wild
Order up a shot, prescription filled up now
Pop another (what?) distracted by the rush while
we fight all night about what to name the love child
I'm on that go nuts life that got that gold touch
Fresh fly wild bold what like the cold crush
No luck, don't hold much, just an old flush
made up of hearts Queen high off the faux-blush
Freak outs, leak out, and bleed out, and speak out
and reroute and seak out the weak crowd
And we doubt, but when I see it keep out
the beast I'll believe for now, it's all ""peace, I gotta be out.""

warm beer, cold women
I just don't fit in)
It goes 1, it goes 2, it goes
3-2 red dog in the hoodie
too much ""person"" in your ""ality"", the friction could be
Should we continue with dialogue as I study these new faces
I would fix my shoe laces, but the room place was
Shoes cut loose at the front door,
got dirty socks, I'm on the floor
and thoughts is what I hunt for
Driftin in and out of conversations I know nothing about
Fuck your topics, I didn't come to see you
But yo I'm here, might as well make the worst of this warm shitty beer
and I'm nursin it, and cursin it
I'm sick of it, but still grippin it and sippin it
Hopin it'll dull the pain of the sight of your lips flippin' shit
So here I sit, inside my atmosphere
I don't know a single motherfucker here,
but maybe that's my fear
Pull out my notebook and let go

Not so pleased to meet you,
and I hate techno
I only came to see the girl that lives here,

This one goes out to all of those that want success
Wait, not just the ones that want it
This goes to those that feel they deserve it
And this one goes to all of those that make the moves
and those that have paid the dues
To all of those that walk the fine line on the edge
To all the heads about to break it loose
And you don't want to come close to feeling it
Initial reaction like ""Yo, I don't give a shh...""
After a minute within it, they start to think
""Why the hell they didn't get it, did they not hear what he speaks?""
They don't know me, it's best that way
Let 'em look for tomorrow in yesterday
And let me strain my lungs for the love of popping amps
Let me spike the ball because I don't like to dance
Let me paint a picture on the surface of your mind
I got a job at the circus and I quit writing rhymes
Now I travel from city to city, life of a gypsy
Gravel, grass, concrete, folk law and mystery
Yo, looking at my Gucci, it's about that time
for me to pawn this piece of junk and try to take some of these finds
Fly angel fly, don't ever look back
You better scoop that dead rat off the track, go home and cook that
Maybe you should trade that Mustang for a Jeep
So when you get too drunk to drive, you'll have a dry place to sleep
Don't forget what chocolate milk does to the hangover
Come on, who you think cut the tires on your Land Rover?
Twist the nobs and chew the fat off the shish kebab
Ditch the lard that cut my hair and made me quit my job
And if I pass before they get a chance to hear me
Tell 'em ""Kiss my ass"" and teach 'em all about my theory
[Chorus: 4x]
Choking on a wishbone, position blown out the frame
Pissed on the remains to mark the spot and spark the flame
[Slug]
It never settles, the constant grinding of metal
against complicated timing, developing my threshold
Touching the gestalt with a little reverb and some echo
to add extra flavor like pesto
Yo, the cards are dealt and now I'm staring at my hand
Looking for something to toss, tryna find a spot to stand
The anger felt as I look across the land
It doesn't equal to the eagerness and hunger to expand
Move past, the berry is set, the previous sets
carry me through the meaninglessness
Here I am with the word extracting nerves
Running toward the stage (here we go) to watch the crash occur
[Chorus: 2X]
[Slug]
Put your head on the pillow and shut your eyes
Take your mind out the ghetto and touch the sky
Then come ease down that much feared trail of blood, sweat and love
Instead of flame, crying tears in the rain
The blunder game, and it drowned out the hunger pains
Numbed the brain and played life like a numbers game
Poppa needs a new pair of nuts, cause he lost touch
with the last ones fastened to the bottom of his guts
Yo, they don't know me, it's best that way
Let 'em look for tomorrow in yesterday
This child is your fate so let 'em play
I bet I know your age and I can guess your weight
Wait, wait, how can it be so simple and straight?
And why the hell ain't you tripping to make some ripples in the lake?
I can't figure it out, for God's sake arguing a lost case
as it irritates my prostate, and when I sit home alone
I kick over the telephone and catch my zone inside the dial tone

The story got lazy so I rewrote the ending
Manipulated the entry, more user friendly
Now a city full of painpills and tatooes defend me
I waver from the dead to the halfdead
Grey space between the fanbase and the crackhead
Sunset, sailboat set course for hell
A cross and a hammer, but you'll have to get some nails
Take credit, for anything embedded in the edit
As long as you meant it when you said it
And all of the kids laugh, when you admit that
It mighta been witchcraft that made my noose fit bad
Well I'ma act like I don't give a make love
Take what I got to teach everyone to break stuff
I'ma act like there's poison in the pancakes
And amputate the one that wasn't loyal with the handshakes
Proud to know ya, Minnesota missle
Never sold coke and I never had to hold a pistol
Civil and simple, but set the freakshow
Loose on the nipple, watch her whole fuckin titty ripple
It's why we battle, it's why we travel
It's why the mascott thinks that I'm an asshole
We made the team without puttin on a uniform

Smart went crazy, but where did you go
Smart went crazy, but where did you go
Smart went crazy, where did you go now

Smart went crazy, kiss Ms. Daisy
Loved you like every night was christmas baby
Maybe we can take it back to the way we was
Still on some ""what have you done for me lately""
No gravy if the base is porkface
Tourdates ate my big little brother's courtcase
Poor taste got passed up as gourmet
This beer is foreplay
We'll meet up at your place
I sting like a first divorce, or them first Newports
Whatever hurts you more
""You're headed for self destruction"" been there, did that
kick back with the wrong angel to fuck with
Carve my charm into your arms
Fuck around, unravel this tall ball of yarn
Snuck round back to disarm the alarm
From the plantation to the reservation to the farms
And nobody knows where you'll end up
Only guarantee in life is death or a headfuck
Yea, you thought it was a set up, well guess what
You you can catch up with the rest of my ""Best Of""
I got a few blocks left before I reach my destionation
And retrieve my breath
And god blessed every step I stole
Just to let me know, she wouldn't ever let me go

through material-fertilized eyes and fantasize then walk
I use my vocals like chalk to sketch the picture you can see it
See unfold what I thought in my mind when I free it
Did the swallow get caught? Yo, does your throat feel tight?
Do you see what can happen when Atmosphere grabs the mic?
Just a word for you it's funny and I think you caught its fever
All that shit you watch on TV has made you a believer
You don't have to like me, bitch, cause I don't really like you either
I don't care if you're rich, I had your girl, and I'mma leave her
Word, I'm eager, to disrespect the petty thoughts of many reps
As I take steps and climb and leave footprints on your mind
I've designed my own lifestyle words and vowels instead of rifals
And hang out with rhyme pals who tower like the Eiffel...

Wait, did I say my girl? I meant my pimp

And honey, if you wanna purr you gotta register with her
Cause she gets ninety-five percent before any events occur
Sir, your self-imploding ego is adorable
Word, but your immature stee-lo is ignorable
I don't know, maybe I'm just getting too old to flow
How much more must I invent before you seek retirement?
Repent and tell God that you feel shitty bout your actions
Bent in the back and I can only blame my passions
Well rounded relapses kept me at a fraction
When the wind died I found myself spread across the Tascam
How much thought did you put into that verse you brought?
What made you think I wasn't gonna mock? Put a fucking tube sock
In that hole because I think it started to leak
Take two dicks and call me in a week

Work all day all night tryin to get fly
When I get some money imma buy me some time
I cant fight your war until I'm finished with mine

I used to be mad at the government
Redirected some of my anger towards the mother ship
Tryin to guess which shell living hell sleeps under
When the grand scheme plan keeps all these people wondering
Why we still runnin in place frustrated
Pride is mistaken for hate it's upgraded
I got a little breath left let's suffocate it
Point at the epiphanies and call 'em all drug related
The time I spent with my life on bent
Tryin to find the friends inside my head
Must have disengaged every phase of the stage
With my I'm coming I'm coming I'm coming of age
My unofficial autobio
Will be accompanied with tips on how to smile
'cause I found that when they don't see you frown
They never know that you're a threat and they don't sweat you
When you come around
So who's gonna be my next door savior
Step up to your neighbor and do me a favor
Take off the mask let it all collapse
Empty the pack and watch your wings grow back
[chorus]
society becomes jealousy
intimacy becomes intensity
say it with a smile like it's meant to be
and all of a sudden BOOM American family
and I could tell when you're mad at your past
because you tend to take them turns just a little too fast
I could tell how you pushed your foot on the gas
that you already knew that you was gonna finish last
slow it down and take a little time
to look up at them clouds with that fake silver lining
up in a tree knowin damn well you'll never reach the top
but you don't stop, you keep climbing
well O-K it's settled
no more nights in this weed and thorn infested meadow
uh uh from this day forth only forward I pedal
get the memo I'm cutting the strings Geppetto
shuffle the cards and let's argue
rooted in between the computer games and cartoons
stop it watch us all get lost
between God and a shot of scotch
let's get fly
[chorus]
uh huh... gon' work all day work all night
uh huh... won't fight your war until I'm finished with mine
uh huh... gonna forward move, gonna buy me some time
uh huh... I'm cutting your strings and keeping my smile

Her American Express card says Gothika
With some black lipstick on certain occasions
Take first place in a pageant like Jean Benet
Be found in the basement dead the next day
Choke her best friend with a Jawbreaker perhaps

Take muscle relaxers so she can relax
Be a prom queen with a set her veins black

I can't imagine a better place for Debbie
Sleeping at her weight so peacefully
Act twice her age relate with sex and amphetamines
Live the glamour life be treated like a beauty queen

See the pyramids experience ecstasy
Become a piece of meat inferior to Hennessey
Sell her body for money whenever hungry and cold
Take it all back to 15 before she lost control

Get some implants cause natural won't cut it

Never be a virgin again out of frustration

She wants a house on the hill with a spectacular view
An ounce of some pills and a bunny tattoo
Appeal to the masses a Hollywood actress
A face made of plastic and voluptuous assets
Flirt with disease I'm concerned with HIV
Keep health and hygiene a secret from you and me
See her name and life behind a scene of fiends
She wants to be famous overnight but this her eulogy

Raggedy Ann
Give a disease to everybody that's her plan
Make up some stories to start gossip
Make up her face with the best makeup
Be the only women who really lived her life
Be the spokesperson for teenage suicide
Beat herself up a bloody mess like molecules
Deal with the stress resolve the rest with sharp tools
Escape the place of all the misery and sorrow
Confront death abandon the world and see tomorrow
Blame the world before she leaves to save face
Unaware that the life between the wait suffers the same face

I devoured the whole bag and I feel I'm about to gag
And to the porceline goddess
Honestly, my eyes are swollen red
I took 4 gallons of OJ to the head
Now I'm more than half dead
More like ho dead, undead walkin zombie banshee
Antsy from all these vital ticks and twitches
Wishes of new visuals
An' individual light streams to stop they crews
And allthese creams and blues
And mabs, guavas, lime greens

hi this is a message for sean
i don't know if i am going to be able to deliver this very well
but um here it goes
can't understand the compatibilty between a rat and a monkey
because eight years changes your whole mentality
and can i ask how many times was it your subconcious mind
that made the decision
that resulted in the unwanted confrontations
the parking violations
and the boy with the arab strap
listening to the dead air on the radio
trying to decide which exit to take on the I-94
feeling kinda lost
having misplaced the directions say
still three circles
careful not to lair
one week later i find out i've got the whole rest of my life to live
but nothings for certain i could die tomorrow
and i don't know if you know who this is
but i can smell the liquor on your breath
i was just wondering if you might like to sit
and talk
about the carpet and the ceiling for a while
(slug)
wise men couldn't see it in they dreams
but up rose the poets from the speed queens and the weed fiends
speakings dissected deciphered by the undernourished purists
no longer is it a get over situation
what are you really saying? (do you think she's listening?)
what are you really saying? (do you think she's really listening?)
what are you really saying? (do you think she's really listening?)
do you think she's listening?
if it makes you feel better
go ahead, make me feel small
i know what you're up to
baby build the wall
you think you've seen it all
and life has no surprises
until you call out my name and return you get silence
she's a high-plains drifter, loner
baby's a rebel
cool disposition gets ya
shows ya new level
crazy abrasive
enough to make me wanna taste it
figure out what makes it tick
so i can dig it out and break it
curiosity killed the cat
but liquor helped me build back all of the confidence stripped
intrigued by the fact
that she could fuck, shower and bounce out my house like that
left me sleepin with my doubts
ok wait I know her scheme
self-inspired detachment
keeps her cold like the breeze
she needs the heat of passion
good bedroom savvy
break your back kinda fun
wild buck turn the beats up
i'm loud when i come
and out of nowhere
she says word i'll go there
should we leave now or do you wanna stay awhile
she says i don't care
instantly
my jacket it on and i'm a wreck
tip with me
baby where'd you park let's jet
yo she's the kinda girl that doesn't want no relationship
but damn i think she's kinda cool
but damn just be patient kid
regular basis with sex for quite a while
puppy chased his tail, caught it
yo he wants the idol now
never should have brought it like that
cause now when i think about it and look back
i'll never forget the way she laughed
when i asked if the only way i'll ever get to see her is
when she's on her back
b-b-b-but the first time we fucked was shakin', wild
digital underground style
no lie no exaggeration
glad to make your acquatence
what's your name again?
molly, good golly miss
here take my digits, please call me
she was cool like that
yo how'd you get like that
i never had a date that gave me head like that
and it was said like that
and she replied with a thank you
before you leave molly
let me kiss that tattoo on your ankle
and she was out
didn't see her again for a week
no call
and when she see me no attempt to speak
so like a good bitch
i make the example
'baby, how you been?'
half an hour later we in the car fuckin like old friends
turn on the dome light
to get my pants on right
travel safe, see your ass around
have a good night (bye)
that's it no conversation,
game playin over some coffee
she's out
moments after she pulls that body off me
(what you gonna do?)
i'm stressed, i'm stressed, i'm stressed,
i'm so confused
she doesn't seem like the type that's that loose
or maybe she does
realistically i don't know her that well
but if you let me i'd follow that sexy ass to hell and back
tell her that (tell her that)
you think she's really listening?
yo you think she's really listening?
yo you think she's really listening?
yo you think she's really listening?
if it makes you feel better
go ahead, make me feel small
i know what you're up to

that-night-sunshine-blues,2005,atmosphere,Hip-Hop,"Don't even know if I can write this song
Caught on a beam between right and wrong
Gotta keep forward, keep straight
For the sake of why we stay awake all night long
Its not up for interpret
Paranoid of exploiting the verdict
But in the same breath
I got thoughts that I wanna express and let surface
This ain't for props or the pop culture
Its about a balloon that got punctured
The sunshine'S fun til it burns someone
And we all got burnt that summer
She was sixteen.
Another young angel with clipped wings
She came to the shows
But I never met her, don't even know if she was listening
That night, we lost a supporter
That night, somebody lost their daughter
He raped and killed her at the venue
Can't comprehend what her friends must have went through
That night the sun went dark
Now watch everyone on the tourbus fall apart
That night, lord have mercy
The music died, that night, in Alberquerque
Stop, it can't be true right
This type of real deaont happen to you right?
Crescent, Murs, Dibbs, Jaybird
I wanna go home now and start a new life
Wish I could protect the kids
I guess safety's a hit or miss
With a prior convicted sex-offense against a 4 year old
Why we let you live?
Don't know what I'm trying to write
But there's a part of me that keeps dyin at night
When I think about her mother
I become another number that wants you to suffer
You're locked up for now, you have no more chances to steal the children's laughs
And if you ever find God
Better pray to her and ask that we never cross paths"
industrial-warfare,2005,atmosphere,Hip-Hop,"There's dark satanic mills and there's green and pleasant hills
Could be riding through Lancashire with all it's
Witchcraft dead industrial air
You can hear a melancholy desert song
And smell George Orwell as a funeral goes on
There's plenty with a license to prostitute
And room to develop the ultimate building
The air in here is dead industrial and so austere
The air round here smells of religion and Vauxies beer
We are this world we watch the sands drain from our hands
We're naive but happy or so it seems
We've all seen the big red bus faces gazing expressionless
The breakfast joint to kill the beast helps sow the
Seed for all manner of dangerous things
Here it goes again as melancholy as the last one
And when you feel as dogmatic as the next
It's time to read into what it is that you do
The air in here is dead industrial and so austere
The air round here smells of religion and Sunday dinner
We are this world we watch the sands drain from our hands
This is our world we are the waters that we learned to work
You can hear a melancholy desert song
And smell George Orwell as the funeral goes on
There's plenty with a license to prostitute
And room to develop the ultimate building
The air in here is dead industrial and so austere
The air round here smells of religion and Vauxies beer
We are this world the sand drains from our very hands
We're naive but happy or so it seems

Maybe pass out on the kitchen floor with your naked ass?
She still makes time to hate me
but basically I'm overbooked no emotional vacancy
Complacency seems so simple
Like fuck it let me be the one you fight and call mister right
It's and addiction bound to stick around
cause a junky won't bounce 'till he hits the ground (get down)
And these drugs ain't as good as we wish they were (get up)
and this buzz doesn't keep us from missin' her (get over)
And that love that built all of this emphasis
spilled enough guilt to kill Electra and Oedipus (get out)
It's easier to leave it there

I wanna keep a clear sky and fly away like a meteor
outta here maybe next year I'll reappear

I say hey there, we don't play fair
we can't stay here, I hope you take care [4X]
Sometimes you make me feel like such a prick
That even I'm convinced that I'm the one thats sick
You can fuss and bitch, you can cut your wrist
or you can choke on that blood from the tounge you've bit
And when you acted up, best believe I blessed you back
I've got a fucking fan base that can attest to that
I'm returning this bleeding hearts club membership card
cause I want no motherfuckin' part of it
We're just two dogs on all fours
It's a tug of war for who loves you more
Blame it on tours or locked bathroom doors
or maybe it's 'cause my voice was louder than yours (what? You jealous?)
And I'll be damned if I do this for forever
Everybody lookin' at me like I don't know better
Instead I gotta run if I'm ever gonna forget her
cause I've always been a go-getter (so whatever)

And now I got a head full of better off dead
I followed down them steps, and slept in the wrong bed
If I had a breath of self-respect left
I'd set fire to the boxspring to help it catch wreck
Let these ashes represent the mattress
Director left the set but nobody told the actress
So she's still actin' as if we scheduled a practice
and my soundtrack is compromisin' her theatrics
You, you remind me of me, it's not a compliment
Get your song on
You, who you tryin' to be?
I've got no tolerance left for drama
You, you would like to go free, jump off the fence let your claws out
You, you remind me of me, run from all of them 'til they all gone
Then, here we go again, with my threats to leave
Like I've ever left a she who wouldn't let me breathe
Instead I kept it deep enough to get you to believe
that I'm incapable of escapin' and settin' you free
Well I'mma open up that map and see the nation
Call it vocation
Call it a vacation
You can find me at the airport waitin'
or maybe I'll be chain smokin' down at the train station
With the pose of a mack and my clothes in a sack
Gotta go and I don't know when I'll be back
Get my last paycheck, smash and make steps
Gone, on the run with Kool G. Rap in the tapedeck (peace)

Infernal, purple clouds pour acid rain and it drowns your perception of a classic
That's the same classic that has 300 parts and there all on MTV

I'm turnin' off the TV when it starts
I feel nauseous cuz its awful rotten old coast
Blah flow, dumb sound somehow got him dope

How is it you feel as if you can afford to ignore the visit
Come and catch a glimpse of persistence

The breathing lasts longer beyond the patterns of you

Brainwashed in this ocean

[verse 1]
Came to get an oil change,
for my girlfriend's car.
But by the time I had left,
I was short of breath, and broken hearted.
There she was, bent over a motor,
dirty cap with a ponytail that sat between her shoulders (beautiful).
Oil slick that must have kissed your cheekbone,
thick and veluptuous, I wish that we could be alone.
I would love to
touch you,
rub you,
see what's covered up under that greasy blue jumpsuit.
Standing there, holding that dripping dipstick,
with a firm grip,
yet so delicate.
And the way you took that orange oil rag and wiped it clean,
that's guarenteed to get repeated in my dreams.
You make me wild,
feels like puppy love.
Got so lost in your smile,
when you asked me what the milage was.
and if I ever learn to change my own oil,
I promise that this customer
is gonna remain so loyal.
[chorus]
[verse 2]
now there's this hamburger stand,
30 minutes outta town.
Usda go for the best veggie burgers around.
That was until I met this round,
guarenteed to astound.
Short order chef,
eyes deeper than sound.
She wore a dirty green apron
like a silk nightgown,
her cappachino fingernails
wrote my order down.
Three dots tattooed between her thumb and her index,
24 waist with a holster full of windex.
The heat from the grill made her mascara drip,
the sweat on her face showed the fuzz on her lip.
Her workpants couldn't hide the love in them hips,
call it bad taste,
but this girl was the shit.
It was the way the hairnet kinda covered up her ear,
that had me askin why the fuck she was even workin here.
But the next time I get hungry,
I'm gonna drive to Pasadina,
'cause I just gotta see her,

Up and around to see the same shit from her
She gets so silent, watchin' life just pass by in a blur
Ain't it funny?
We can sneak into our lives undisturbed?
Over the perfect things to say
And then just choke on the words?

Everybody wanna be in step
Everybody wanna fuck
Everybody want the consequence of playin' the fence

Strolling, so vagrant, so shaken, so grown, so god so mistaken
So broke, so, so complacent, so worn out, so worn out, so worn out
So full of doubt, so full of restrain
So full of that self-control, or the lack thereof

But I used to fantasize about the guts
Fuck, bust nuts, rush
Grab the gold and carry it in your mouth
But I'm a try to hold the microphone and turn the party out

So maybe I can persuade some lady out of her bra (come on baby)

We now ask that you give a warm Minnesota nice welcome to MC
I've your man on the mic, you know...
Ladies and gentlemen, give it up
Put your hands together, put your hands...

We'll do it apart

Tall sharp and handgun, paid a ransom for these pants dun

Killed all the thoughts about killing all the cops
No longer get as pissed off when I have to jerk my dick off
I just want a mic and a crowd and if that's asking for too much
Fine, lemme just have that mic and I'll be alright (I'll be alright)
Stuck, between a rock and the sky
With an option to buy and I got lost in a lie
Tossed them fakes out the door, I ain't your whore
I make music, can you feel it?
Cool, then I'm a make some more
Yes, yes y'all you are now rocking with the best of the mess hall
In root to the basement, while Ant drives the vessel
All apologies to those insulted
By the repulsive vultures that fly loose when I'm seduced by the impulses

From all forms of public infliction

it takes focus off what's the mission

To be the man that made you push rewind
To be that mother fucker over there on that mic

Yo, check it out
After I lacerate, what you think you coming back to take?
You aggravate tryna bite me, but I don't feel it
My philosophy is to keep all the lock and keys
Everything I got, conceal it, so they don't steal it
I'm stuck in poverty, but I keeps my head banging
So my kind of life keeps me aware of the trifling
(Bitch, you bitch) Is that the only thing you pay attention to?
And if it wasn't then I probably wouldn't mention you
It's like that, listen (money) now to flock in
But I told you (use your brains) my SoundScan's dropping
There's only two options, huh, die while grovelling
or be a man and stand to these bitches and coward men
Now and then it's gonna happen, you can believe me
So retreat before the barge comes to street sweep
Slug and Beyond, thus dawn of the end
Snatch your family, your friends before the monster's descend

Working the verses free for the purpose provided by props
Personally, I never gave a fuck
for the mucky murky mass that you're walking through (to get some pudding)
Been standing here for eternity, for a damn long time, forever
Somehow my patience grew muscular
Must be a side effect to the mental exorcism
Maintain, warm up this torn up brain
Strain, struggle, painkilling guzzle
End in poison, just to push the progress of the puzzle
And I'm looking for a quarter-piece, got the corner pieces perfect
Forcing me to see there's more than meets the surface
Mercy me, check the level of the mercury
Must begot the fever man, my helmet really hurting me
Circuitry twisted by a bitch named greed
Now all proceeds is going to smoking more weed
Please, you need to force-feed your head
and set your sights straight ahead and hit warp speed instead
of the foreseeable hate that you've got aimed at my crew
Pull your noble gown and get your shit together

In a day or two, hopefully I'll be away from you

Blow away the ashes, throw away the trash kid
Everlasting to be the ones forever blasting

Open up the doorway, sewn up, pay dirt
Everybody wants to party
full belly still suckin on the parsley

Pan left, pan right, damn right the econoline

Turn it up, let the drummer go BAM!!

Weight loss, pill pop, chaos
Thank god the best plays are made when the game stops BAM!!

That I was outta line BAM!!

I take 'em two at a time, make 'em both say my name
Ain't never had three, but best believe that I'm game
And that's the key game, girl I fit words like scrabble
The inner-city cowboy with the thick herds of cattle
Cruisin' lake street, gene pool ridin' shotgun
Got the flyest tricky's from the Mississippi to Boston
I've got a house full of porn to keep the vibe warm
The doors always open honey, come out of the storm
Yo I got daddy's little girls, ones that always stay true
I've got an uptown girl she dyes her pubic hair blue
And I've got a bitch that lives in Kenwood, rich townhouse flavour
She travels on business I'm gettin' down with the neighbors
I got a freak that drives the bus, shows me love with free rides
One hundred hoes in St. Paul but only one from east side
Got a Bloomington bitch with a pool in her apartment
Rug burns all over from fucking her on the carpet
Got the mega-mall hoes, make them all work the food court
Yo hit me up with a chicken soft taco and a couple of Newports
Got a stripper bitch with body jewels and fake titties
And a hoe that lives in Fargo for when I escape the city

Gimme nine and a half weeks and I'll have that freak flippin two
Distribute and come across the ??
I know its hard being young girl, let me soothe the pain
I understand you baby, straight up I understand
Now lift up your ass so I can pull these fuckin' pants down
The only ones I don't do is those under eighteen
Or at least I keep that shit a secret if you know what I mean
I got sluts that love to give head, and I like to watch
The way they move their tongue up and down my...
[Outro]
Motherfucker! I can't believe your sittin down here
Recordin' some bullshit like this
(Hey man it's just a song, it's just a song, it's like a joke)
Oh, you wanna be a pimp eh? you better take your ass over
To that neglected girl you got there.
(Why you always trippin' on me in front....)
Motherfucker, you got a kid, how you rhyming about some bullshit like this?"
angelface-multiples-5-vs-travel-4,2005,atmosphere,Hip-Hop,"I love this fucking country
And she loved me more than I could imagine
So I waited till she slept then I stepped into traffic
Pan away from the backyard to drift some more
Woke up in Texas next to a liquor store
With a woman who don't even drink alcohol
Big letters IRONY tagged on the wall
She was named for another flat land
We had a strong back then
In common we had a bond
That would never see the break of dawn
To damn afraid of the queen trying to take the pawn
Threw that away
Yes, yes headed out west
And got undressed
With the nurture that she gave me made me trip and get obsessed
There was a lady in Los Angeles
That handled this the way the manual suggests (the way the manual suggests)
She turned me on to music that I never heard before
She told me stories from a cup I had to learn to pour
And I don't know what hurt it more
Professional journals or perpetual burn holes
Scarring up the dirty floor
Peace
Found a hollow hole in the Colorado snow
It's like I follow anywhere el Diablo go
Took a stroll with a feline
And sat silent while the snow flakes fell into the design
Can't let her dance up on top on the top floor
Been there done that what do you think it's locked for?
I've lost more to my traveling soul
Then I care to talk about so I'll be out I'll be on the road
Down, down, down in Gainesville
No stranger to shame, Coletrane, and pain pills
Sometimes the ceiling is to easy to stare at
But it keeps me from a forest full of snare taps and bear traps
And it can't come clean without the sun beams
And it ain't complete without the drum beats
I can tell she don't want me as is
Time to climb back into the van and make the back stiff
I had to add one more story to the infinite
Already interwoven through a New York cigarette
Ex-lover and a best friend
best lover and an ex-friend hoping for alcoholic sentiment
sentimentalism and the rhythm of religion on the PA
Make the people here say
God bless the DJ
She stays to wait for a replay
While I wonder if I'll be able to hear it from the freeway
Chicago inside of an empty bottle
There's a thin line between gossip and gospel
There's a house over there near Wicker Park
Where I found out Smart was afraid of the dark
Had to break her heart just to help me heal up
Tie a knot in the stomach just to help me seal up
And make sure them demons stay beneath the core
Pray for you and yours and whoever you believe in more
Look around you there's angels amongst us
Look around you there's angels amongst us
Sitting in the rain at some sidewalk cafe
Half of her wet cigarette in the ash tray
Just trying to find a lost soul to save
And I'm a lost soul trying to find a road that's paved
Keep faith in my suitcase pack my beliefs
Angels exist I've even seen some sleep
I love this fucking country
And she loved me more than I could imagine
So I waited till she slept then I stepped into traffic"

Yo can I get a Cranberry Citron?
A tall one?
No, no, lemme get a Newcastle, a Newcastle
Yo homie
Had I known
That you'd a grown
Into a full-blown example of how to act like an asshole
I never would have introduced you to booze and skipping school
'Cause right now I feel responsible to find an answer
Yo, yo, back in junior high when you and I started getting high
Life was just a joke, we was too young to know the punch-line
And you would sooner die then realize you're running out of time
Who's to decide there's no more recess after lunch-time
Bam, here you am, intoxicated again
Yo, how you doin' man?
Yeah it's good to see you
Bam, here you am, intoxicated again
He used to be my man, understand?
I believe you've slightly exceeded (slight exceeded)
How many of them drinks that you think you need when
You're trying to boost the bonus points and reinforce your voice
But I'm not trying to walk within your obnoxiousness (hell naw)
We used to be friends back in the day when you had direction
But that was before your brain felt that infection
And I ain't claiming innocence
I was right there with you then
I'm just sayin'
While we was waiting to move up, some of us grew up
We all knew what the difference between wrong and right was
Sometimes the line blurred, when we was influenced by a light buzz
But from what I see, you've established the persona
Basis, built from foundation, for emulating the genre, drama
Without taking a moment to ponder, the trail of karma that you've weaved
Through the field that you've wandered
No longer am I shocked by the things you do
I'm just confused as to why it's gotta be me to confront you
I guess nobody else gives a damn
So I gotta go for self, 'cause I'm a man
Understand?
And you can take it as concern
Or you can see it as your ego getting burned
Either way, tonight yo, one of us is gonna learn
And I guess nobody else gives a damn
But see I do
Because you used to be my man, understand?
And even if it means you beat me down to the cement
It's all love, I need to see you stick around until the end

As you call? em they call you when they need somethin?
Trees for the blunt, two G's for the front
I found a way to get peace of mind for years and left the hell alone
Turn a deaf ear to the cellular phone
Send me a letter or better, we could see each other in real life
Just so you could feel me like a steel knife
At least so you could see the white of their eyes
Bright with surprise once they finish spittin? lies
Associates, is your boys, your girls, bitches, niggaz, homies?
Close, but really don't know me
Mom, dad, comrade, peeps, brothers, sisters, duns, dunnies
Some come around when they need some money
Others make us laugh like the Sunday funnies
Fam be around whether you paid or bummy
You could either ignore this advice or take it from me
Be too nice and people take you for a dummy
So nowadays he ain't so friendly
Actually they wouldn't even made a worthy enemy
Read the signs, no feeding the baboon
Seein? as how they got your back bleeding from the stab wounds
Y'all know the dance, they smile in your face, y'all know the glance
Try ta put 'em on, they blow the chance
Never let your so-called mans know your plans
How many of us have them? A show of hands
Friends is a term some people use loosely
I'm real choosy on what I choose to let crews see
You telling me, I try to act broke
Jealousy, the number one killer among black folk
Fellas be under some type of spell like crack smoke
Ghetto Cinderellas, lead 'em right to your stack, loc
Just another way a chick'll lead to your end
I check the dictionary for the meanin? of? Friends?
It said, person, one who likes to socialize with
Sympathize and help her and that's about the size of it
Most of the time these attributes is one-sided
To bolster the crime they opt to shoot you through your eyelid
And they can't hide it goin? wild like a white bitch
Sometimes you need to cut niggaz off like a light switch
Click, and when things get quiet
Catch 'em like a thief in the night, bow, what a riot
I first met Mister Fantastik at a arms deal
Don't let it get drastic, think of how your moms will feel
When it get for real the steel get to sparkin?
Everything darken and ain't no talkin?
For somethin? so cheap it sure buys a lot of trouble
You better off focusing than tryin? to plot the bubble
Or else it'd be a sad note to end on, the guns we got
One's we can depend on, friends
Some come in the form of co-dependence
A lotta times only end up bein? co-defendants
Ten bucks say they? ll tell for a lower sentence
And leave you up under the jail beggin? for a penance
It don't make no sense, what happened to the loyalty?
Honor amongst crooks, trust amongst royalty
I'd rather go out in a blaze, than give 'em the glory
How many of us have a similar story, friends?
Before lovers we used to have some type of over standing
Just so when I let her get the man-thing she know it? s no strings
We could do the damn thing but, hoe, it? s no rings
Just how the tramp swings, will she see 'em again?
That depends on how good was the skins
And could she memorize the lessons
It ain't no need to pretend
Even though she let 'em stab it, she know they just, friends

Friends, ones we can depend on?

I'd actually lend a little credibility to your statements
But honestly, your penmanship's fucked
The way I see it, someone should at least slap you for even holding a marker
I hope the kid who wrote my name in the entry bathroom
Has the nuts and time for us to sit and chat soon
So I can ask 'em ""Why the fuck am I on your mind bitch?""
You could've signed it, but stayed silent cause you're spineless
If you was a man, you'd come at me on the mic level
But you're light yellow just like the walls on which you write fellow

But now I've accepted it, in fact I kind of like this
I really wish I knew your identity
Probably not even an emcee, just another who pretends to be
Or maybe the jealousy of one who's baby-baby has eyes for me
It's nineteen-ninety-sev', nothing surprises me
Envy can make a motherfucker immature
So can boredom, a buzz or the curse of being insecure
C'mon now, some little trick with a marker and a chip
on his shoulder don't mean shit, I want the world in my grip
I bet your girl's on my dick, she digs the skills
She's a bigger head than you, so give me head and head for the hills
Little bitch, donkey dick sucking ass-fuck
Glue sniffing, half a testicle base head selling plasma

are gonna be thanking us for kicking down the door
and putting this shit on the globe

Would you prefer if I remove... MY... UHH?
Nah they. they clean.
I mean. what?
You wanna look at the bottom of...?
[Vers 1]
My shoes are clean girl, how about yours?
Here we are sitting on your living room floor
Listening to some records from your collection
Boredom; in between a coma and an erection
Staring at the skin on your shoulder blades
And you don't take your eyes off my poker face
I'm wasted, and your as sober as Jehovah
Knocking door to door, trying to walk to road
That the Mormon's paved
If she was here on your sofa with a beer on a coaster
She'd of told 'ya that my game was way over played
Make no mistake
I love the way you taste like yogurt and some clover cigarettes
Girl show me leg!
So I'ma gonna trade these shoes for rollerskates
And I'ma stay happy just as long as there is a whore to pay
But some of us already spent the rent
So we can't be content until there isn't no more today
[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Those are your shoes
These are my shoes
We've got issues
[Vers 2]
My shoes are muddy girl, how about yours?
Here we are loungin' on your bedroom floor
I'm really drunk so I'm looking at your carpet like
Man, fuck the permit, I know where I'ma park tonight
It's closing time, the spins are gonna visit me
They're rolling thick like they know they taking victory
But not tonight, right, I'ma make some history
Get up in your system and direct it like a symphony
Let me get to be the man of your mystery
'Cause them meddeling kids don't understand your sensitivity
Show some sympathy
Let me kiss your feet
Let's talk about a pretty bird and a busy bee
If I live to see fifty, I'ma be a tipsy, dirty old man
Still following my kid beliefs
I know it isn't really your responsibility
So we'll be strait once I take a hit of Listerine
[Chorus]
Those are your shoes
These are my shoes
We've got issues
[Vers 3]
I can't find my shoes girl, how about yours?
Here I am naked on your bathroom floor
I got faded, and you fell asleep
And I'm thanking God that this date was hella cheap
Sitting down, trying to keep the liquor down
Light, stars and sounds everything flickers now
Sick bound, the whole room twists around
In front of the toilet assume the position to drown
Here it comes! Whiskey out bounces all over the floor
Now I'm sitting in the bitches mound
I'm just a clown and I'm sorry I found it funny
When you tripped over my shoes and hit the ground
Didn't know you would rip your gown
Didn't think you would shout and get so loud, get so wound
Yeah I'm drunk, but I'm more than a little proud
I'm leaving, fuck the shoes you keep them, I'm getting out

Those are your shoes
These are my shoes
We've got issues

Dear Jacob
I won't take up too much of your time
I know you're trying to get your video-game grind on
And that's fine
Just gimme a second to empty my face
Before I hit the road again to go and win this paper chase
I've been watching you and-
I'm proud of you man
You're growing up to be the best man that you possibly can
I know you understand
Why I go out of town
I also know my days are colder when you're not around
Sometimes I wonder what it's like to be adapted to the fact
That daddy never lived inside the same shack
And sometimes I get this pain in my stomach's pit
It's what I get
I'm convinced it's my punishment
For those nights I got drunk and let go; at some bar
In some city with some people I don't know
For all the times that the lines on your face
Reminded me of the days before the dragonflies escaped
It trips me out how you pick up all my traits
From the way that you spit to the fists that you make
I watch the way you try to keep your mom happy
Daddy learned that from you
You're supposed to learn that from daddy
I can't teach much when it comes to women
I drive safe and slow but don't know nothing 'bout the engine
You're doing good little man that's all I really meant
I love you
You're my best friend, thanks for listening
[Verse 2]
Dear Craig,
What up bones? How it goes?
Yeah, me? Well, you know, you know, same old, same old
Sorry that the phone calls ain't too routine
Just been runnin' around the globe tryin' to do my thing
Sometimes the weeks fly a little too fast
And sometimes I go to sleep a little too trashed
Other times I'm not sittin' on enough cash
And other times today feels too much like the past
Sometimes at night I would watch y'all fight
A child wonderin'
Why your life just ain't alright?
What's the violence about? Why's it in my house?
And even the memories are turned up too loud
Yeah, I got some issues in my head
Knew we should've started fixing 'em back when she left you
I'm not trying to get you down, I know you're different now
But your little man justs wants you to listen now
I'm over thirty, can't maintain relations
All these women wanna hurt me and I just don't have the patience
I can't trust 'em
And they're not much help
When they start to push and pull the buttons I don't trust myself
What pride, fists, and words just might do?
I'm afraid of my fate, don't wanna turn out like you
I've never hit a woman
I won't do coke
And for that alone I love you and I wanna thank you old man
[Verse 3]
Dear Sean
What's goin' on?
Not much to say
Just checkin' in wit'cha trying to see what's wrong today
I know there's gotta be something kickin' your bruises
How's the love? How's the music? How's the self-abusiveness?
Got a lot to lose, it's breakin' your shoulders
So you let your paranoia place your bets for you
Too many cigarettes, messin' up your voice
Too many arguments, tryin' to test your poise
The only women that love you are fans and family
Mom has no choice, but fans leave you randomly
No heavy rotation
In any location
You're not ready to face that you have no steady vocation
Plus you're gettin' old, your raps are exhausted
Stop it, everybody knows that you've lost it
Singin' for these kids you don't know
When you should be at home with your own; instead you're on your telephone
Fightin' with your girl like it's you against the world
Another drunk hotel bedroom corner, curled up like a naked fetus
Come and save him Jesus
Place him back in time before the Reaganomics and Adidas
Sometimes you're not impressed with the work you've done
And love isn't love if you didn't hurt someone
Your son says, ""Hi dad.""
Your dad says, ""Whats up?""
And me, I wanna thank you, but I won't, I'll just say, ""Good luck."""

And if I don't really know you I'ma lie and say I'm fine
And I spit rhymes hoping that someone who thinks like me
Related to the emotions interlocked within the phyche
Spit rhymes to catch chicks to catch hope
To catch that ear of the kid who says 'damn that shit is dope' (damn that shit is dope)

And I sit in the same chair under the same light
Round the same time a night when I write

Watch the loads it holds
As the soul unfolds
Track my faith as I wade through a pack a day
Have to wait call me back next saturday

Touch the heart and lay the carcass on the campfire
Burn baby burn and take your cents with ya
If the shoe don't fit ya remove it to lose the business
Get the car started warm it up for the journey
Wake up abuse and shake of the blues
And make stops to fill the tank stops to urinate
Stops to meditate and let the thoughts resonate
Stops to celebrate stops just for heavens sake
Stops in an attempt to make the bad shit and get it straight
The ashma regualtes the breath control so thanks for the tapes
And eat your vegetables and yo I write it for me and if you like it that's love
And if you don't that's life cause life don't like slug

Kept it in check with the skeptics and the essense when it

Tell me who can hold the noose while I make certain it fits me
Judgement first impresstion naturally shifty
Each one tried to teach one when it begun
Struggling for freedom tryin to build a kingdom
Now your sippin Segrums tryin to fix a threesome
Between you your girl and that freak with the nissan

And lace the spliff and make sure that dosage is right

How long does it take for the pace to break down
Another lonely little trophy
If only I could walk a straight line, I'd make it home free
And everybody in this bar thinks they know me
And my story like poor me

And it makes me crazy trying to pay em no mind

Who had the most beautiful tattoos
On the top sides of both of her hands
She was forty-three years old and as far as I know
Had never yet been with a man
It's not that she wasn't attractive
She was beautiful but it was the way that she interacted
She was aggressively passive to the point
Where she would've intimidated any mitt
That ever tried to catch it
On the right hand she had a tattoo of a nude girl
She claimed it is what God resembled
But on the left she had a mirrored image of the same female
And this one she explained looked like the devil
I remember once watching her touch her own breasts
How the tattoos smiled as they stared down her stomach
As if anticipating when they'd be allowed to caress
The sweet flower that they both seemed to hunger
(Sweet flower)
Now maybe I was high but it felt so right
Heaven and Hell both take to this woman's womb
It didn't make sense how she could commence
Touching herself with me wide awake in the same room
But if I've learned anything in my years
(My years)
I learned I no longer believe in surprise
(In surprise)
But what happened next damn near stoled my tears
The tattoos came alive right in front of my eyes
They both slowly stood up and climbed off her hands
And showed me why she never took some time with a man
They climbed deep inside of this woman's garden
She closed her eyes and she gently bit her bottom lip
I stepped I left and I don't regret leaving
And I'll never forget all the things I saw that evening
A glimpse of religion a piece of coming closer
To understanding more about what intrigues me most
I didn't get turned on I just got turned
I wasn't as aroused as I was concerned
For each one of 'em I've hurt and every time I've been burned
I've got a lot to teach but even more to learn
So now I keep my eyes open hoping to take in all I can
About women taking in all she can
And for as long as I breathe I'll save receipt
In my memory for that woman with the tattooed hands
There's good and evil in each individual fire
Identifies needs and feeds our desire
As long as we keep our spirit inspired
She can bite her bottom lip all she wants
There's good and evil in each individual fire
Identifies needs and feeds our desire
As long as we keep our spirit inspired
She can bite her bottom lip all she wants
There's good and evil in each individual fire
Identifies needs and feeds our desire
As long as we keep our spirit inspired
She can bite her bottom lip all she wants

7:30 AM, Alerted to life by a song on the radio
The evening is over
Another morning, another opportunity
To do something progressive prove that he's worthy
Up and out the door by 9 O'clock
The sun is shining up and down the block
There's children in the corner waiting for a bus
That will take them to school and exploit their trust
He starts the car, sparks with one crank
It's those good ol' fashioned American mechanics
And even though he'd rather own a new import
It's dependible and more important its all he can afford
Stops by the coffee shop to pick up some smokes and a cup of Joe
Back into the Ford with the windows rolled up
So when the radio rocks he can sing along freely
With the lights out it's less dangerous
At the top of his lungs the words burst through shameless
Pushing that dream, trying to beat the time
Oh well whatever nevermind
Nothing else matters when your knifing through traffic
Wishing it was a stickshift, it's an automatic
Listening to the road, voice of the nomad
How he'd love to leave drive away never go back
Wheels keep on turning, turning turning and turning
Alone is when he finally feels like a person
Light another Nat Sherman
Crack the window, feel the wind blow
Serenity tenfold
God bless whoever invented sunglasses
And while your at save the saints that work the fast food drive throughs
Objects are closer than they appear
'cause when your by yourself there ain't one else to lie to
Talk radio gets a lot of play in his vehicle
It teaches him topics to dicuss with real people
So when he stops to get gas or hit that coffee shop
His neurotic ass can act like he knows a whole lot
Pour some sugar on me, my counterfeit personality
He's a loner dottie, he's a rebel
He's gonna drive the escort to the middle of that meadow
Thinking about how he can leave this city
Fill the tank and towards the water he'll flee or,
Maybe he should just go get a picture at the CC
And find a stool at the bar where he can stare at the TV
Either way tomorrow will be just like today
And that's all it takes to make the change
He loves to drive more than he loves being alive
And this town doesn't even know his real name
It goes bye bye Miss American Pie
Drove the Ford to the border to disturb the order
If only that he'd know that he wouldn't be missed
Maybe then he could have grown to exist

Its the theme of where we're goin')
[Verse 1: Slug]
See the police man, notice the lonely man
How do you think he keeps his head on straight?
Can you feel his rhythm? What do you think he visions
When he squints at the line from behind those shades
Feel the summer's crest, overdressed
So much sweat, his skin begins to chafe
Its the surface sweat the nervous mess
Overbearing and jaded from carrying the weight
Irritated and constipated
And its all covered player hated,funnelled and consolidated
Into the shell of one man with a gun
Riding that thin line between the program and the sun
And I don't hate you, tryin to relate to
Wishin you could find a trap door to escape through
But if I see you, as a threat to my seedling or my sibling
Ill die to pull the plug on your machine
[Chorus: (2X)]
And I just might just find somebody
And I just might just love somebody
And I just might just feel somebody
And I just might just kill myself (somebody)
[Verse 2: Slug]
Can you see her?
She spends her whole day in a theater
Livin her time in the life that she would prefer
& she stirs nothing, comes & goes she wishes
Surroundings oblivious to her whole existence
But if they only knew
About the thoughts that she can't seem to stop from comin through
Comin' across
At a loss for dialouge
Walkin through the fog
With her eyes closed & her mind gone
And now she lives in the films that she sees
And daydreams that she kills us repeatedly
I'm impressed with the tolerance she brandishes
If it was me, I would snapped from the sheer overanxiousness
of waitin for the day she strolls through Muddy Waters
And slaughters sons & daughters and bloodies mothers and fathers
Lovely little *case*study castaway cutie
Masturbating in back of that matinee movie
And someday, oneday, when the credits roll
She'll hold a pocket full of gunplay for the ignorant souls
Then we'll know what depth awake touches sleep
Make me walk the thin line between shallow and deep
[Chorus: (2X)]
And I just might just find somebody
And I just might just love somebody
And I just might just feel somebody
And I just might just kill somebody (my body)

He used to write his rhymes and recite his lines all the time
Sometimes he'd make them up right off the top of his mind
After doin shows for years, gettin respect from peers
Killed the ego, lookin at these people like *they* weird
Road trips, turn to head trips
Became a hunger for sedatives and essentric ettiqute
Optimism needs to feed off self-esteem
But it seems as if he doesn't see it or hasn't felt a thing
Records sell well but still undergound
Travels town to town
Holdin hands with fans that love his sound
When it comes around *let*s hope you can enjoy it
Don't slow down momentum, afraid he might destroy it
When he stops to shake the hand, I doubt they understand
That here now stands only the shadow of a man
Havin a hard time with life on a drumroll
Walkin that high-wire, passin it off is humble
But it's a thin line,between screams and smiles
Seen the miles, wishin he can go home & read to his child
But tonight's the last day, put the butt in the ashtray
Locked the door and slit both of his wrists backstage
[Chorus: (2X)]

saves-the-day,2002,atmosphere,Hip-Hop,"From the fifth floor, I schedule my meeting with the moon
Stress, let it go, so it don't completely consume.
When the vegetables fight back, and the grass starts to sting
I yell up to Heaven to get me the hell out of this dream
I fell out of my stream of self-consciousness
And I've got welts on my mind to signify all my accomplishments.
No matter whose math you use to count to ten,
Progress will never rest in the hand that has no head.
Bought my brain a cane and asked it to be my pimp
You know, to make sure I don't stuck up in my fuck-ups
A little over anxious I was to bust nuts,
And find the answers making love, out of a canvas full of touch-ups
I dipped my brush into the what, I've wept for
And wonder out loud as I can, how long I've slept for
I should rob a pet store, let the dogs wild
I should close all the schools just to make the kids smile
Seize the limit, let the sky be the moment
Put the key to the ignition I'ma ride these donuts
And when it breaks, lock the door, walk away
There won't be nothing else to talk about, nothing left to say

See I'm just waiting for the moment I can break away
The only reason that I stay so I can save the day

The only reason that I stay so I can save the day
I'm just waiting for the moment I can break away
The only reason that I stay so I can save the day
See I'm just waiting for the moment I can break away
The only reason that I stay so I can save the day
I'm just waiting for the moment I can break away...
Let's stand on the corner, throw rocks at people
So there's no surprises, written off as evil
I sleep next to women that I don't deserve
They like to hurt my pride, while I work their nerves
Once upon a time it was worth it when the urges get fed
And the purpose finds a path to the surface
Is respect considered a breakfast food?
I'm guilty of the type of attitude that wrecks your mood
The truth can be pain, and I hate to do it
Either face the music, or get away from me stupid
Super glue it down, now it better not move
See I'm not the best, but I'm in the top two
And I'm not that friendly when this cup is empty
It's a side effect from trying to find the fucks that sent me
See I didn't just happen, I was made this way
By the same egomaniac that paved this way
See I'm just waiting for the moment I can break away
The only reason that I stay so I can save the day
I'm just waiting for the moment I can break away
The only reason that I stay so I can save the day"

I attempted to embrace her, she looked so fine,

worrying about which side of the glass projects the reflection clearer.

gassing' me up about the love that I plucked and I've been stuck within,

and for ever set of lips that become attached and equipped with that program
to seek success, i bleed my ethics out a slow drip.

I wanna bash whoever's responsible for this incomprehensible lack of passion
The sucker's been seduced down to the stick
And the peasants fill their bellies with the poisons you omit
I've come to seperate the heads and shoulders
Of these tracin' paper soldiers
That have been designated to take it over
I'ma roll a couple of boulders off the cliff
On the road below (look out below)
'Cause I don't know what I'ma hit (yo)
I live by the word until I die by your sword
Even when I'm dead my head will live inside your RCA cords
I wait for the right time, but it resembled now-a-days
Descended on the Earth to put an end to all your holidays
The assassin covered in plain clothes
Smothered the sunlight and set flame to your rainbows
And then came the storm (and then came the storm)
Bewildered those that didn't contemplate
Fake disguised as the norm (as the norm)
And when the smoke evaporated and the damage was assessed
The casualities were counted as they looked upon the mess
As they focused they eyes on the horizon, who'da guessed?
All that stood atop the hill was number seven silhouette

And my thoughts are not as deep

And my thoughts are not as deep

They say a picture's worth a thousand words
Well I beg a thousand pardons for each word I've used for personal gains
But the letters that float through my head, demote my sentences
Could never be contained by your simple picture frames
For every intoxicated moment, I hate life
I strive to balance my aura by dancing with the light
And sometimes it's difficult to stay quiet
I fight it, each time I find myself walking across your eyelids
Wishin' the malnutrition, the imagination of yours
Could see the truth you breathe through each one of your pores
And now the days are drastic, the nights last forever
Wanna tear this motherfucker up and put it back together
I'd like to ask the cats that act like they my peers
If you spent the energy I've spit, tryin' to count the tears
One of these days you're gonna climb the tallest building of all
Give a warning to those below and let the tears fall

And my thoughts are not as deep
As the day I woke up to discover I lost my sheep

Leaping for these people walking in their sleep

The anguish...felt only by the ones that invest

And everybody was trying to define success
All the self-proclaimed prophets dressed up to look like poets
Pretendin' to be martyrs that they're not

And engrave them on your brains
Memories so you can spout them off the top (spout them off the top)

You'd better find a way, you'd better do it soon
It's like the middle of May and you've only got 'til June
You've found force to watch you touch the torch to that spoon
Even one more time, I swear to God I'm gonna implode
Sky's too high to hold; too thick to pet
So fold up your two-bits and hide them in your wallet
In your pocket full of trauma, in love notes you wrote to the angels
Gathered around the pole, crude and star-strangled
The band turned; married in the bed made from propaganda
I've roamed the avenues of humility
And I've kept a toothbrush in the glove compartment
Next to the napkins
For when I'm finally priveliged and touched with a permanent address
But now I'll be relaxed after this gin and tonic
And I'll bless your track after the impact of a comet
And I'll pay the mortgage after I finish paying homage
I promise, consider it accomplished!
For every cigarette butt that's tried to climb out of my ashtray
Signifies another phase in this cascade
The great mind, great migraine
We think it's difficult enough to just live much less gain
Well I put my two bucks on the table just like the sign says
Proceeded to ask God to give me one good reason why we shouldn't perish
She says it's careless since we are, unstable as we seem
Selected few of y'all have found something to cherish
I countered that, maybe just to be argumentitve, I don't know
But I was like yo, can't we spare the ones that are worth it?
She was like NO, I need the comparisons
I think she could tell by the way I responded that I'm getting a little nervous
So I went far left and just said thank you
Thank you for the time, for the mind
For the breath, for the flesh
Thank you for the quest, thank you for the vision
This vision that spawns anxiety trying to see
and feel why I'm living
Time is money, every moment is costly
So I ration emotion because existance exhausts me
Oddly enough, I'm happy I ain't famous
Imagine waking up to the fact that you're simply entertainment
I bet god thinks you're amusing"

lovelife,2002,atmosphere,Hip-Hop,"Individually wrapped, placed in neat little rows
Becoming a piece, of everything that grows
Some numbers, a name, to indicate you played the game
Came empty handed and left the same
A soul is a soul and a shell is a shell
The border in between is full of everything you felt
Some cling to a cross because they're tired and lost
They leave it up to the weather to measure the cost
And everytime I look within I recognize the darkness
Familiar to the image of the artist
Staring at the bathroom mirror in a strangers apartment
Can't remember her name, don't remember how I got here
But here I am, thinking about death again
Humbles out the stress, helps the breath get in
I need to check my friends as well as my next of kin
To let them know I love them all to the end
And when the soul begins to reap, I think she'll know me from the sleep
I keep caught in the corner of my bloodshot eyes
And if she has the nerve, to let me dump a couple last words
I'm gonna turn to the earth and scream ""Love your life!""
Love your life, quite cliche but I guess thats me
A ball of pop culture with some arms and feet
As discrete as I've tried to keep the drama and cancer
It's no secret I hunger for someone to feed the answers
I never expected a bowl of cherries
I'm just a virgo trying to find my own version of the virgin mary
And when I let them carry me to a cemetary
I wanna be buried with a pocket full of clarity

Now, how many times must you prove you're an angel
How many more demons do you have to strangle
How much longer must you remain in this dream
Before I finally figure out if you're insane or a genius
How many times must you prove you're an angel
How many more demons do you have to strangle
How much longer must you remain in this dream
Before I finally figure out if you're insane or a genius
Let no tears to fall from none of y'all
Just remember it all, the beauty as well as the flaws
L-O-V-E L-I-F-E
Here lies Sean, finally free
And as I look across the sea I smile at the sun
While it feeds the weeds the nutrition they need
The people still breathe, the city still bleeds

I'm going to love it to death and keep an eye on the seeds
I'll be in love till im dead, I keep reaching the seeds
I'll give all I got left just to teach you to read
Love life to the death and keep planting my seeds
And when the soul begins to reap, I think she'll know me from the sleep

If I was a rich man
I'd buy you some shoes
Tall boots for all the dirt you walk through
What would that do?
Enable you to deal
Without schooling you on how to touch what's real
And if I was a smart man
I'd tell you everything that I knew
And give it to you every time you need a talking to
But what would that do?
Teach you my guidelines
So you can be a cheerleader at your game on the sidelines
And if I was a driver
I'd keep my headlights on
To see the difference between right and wrong
I'd wear my seatbelt even when I'm in park
Cause I don't trust the other fools that cruise through these parts
And if I was a better cook
I'd hook up a feast
Set a table full of food for the children to eat
I encourage the nourishment so we can breathe
With the knowledge that we got something accomplished
[Chorus:]
And if I was Santa Claus, I'd fight for the cause
Wouldn't expect nothing in return
I'd give you everything you want, I'd be everything you need
So you can take my hand and I can take the lead
And if I was an honest man
I would stop writing songs
I'd break for a nervous breakdown for breakfast
Tell everyone I knew to stay away from making music
It ain't nothing but a confusing mess (confusing mess)
And if I was you, I wouldn't hear a word I said
Wouldn't trust nothing to start it up inside my head
I'd make a conscious effort to live instead
Of trying to kill the monsters that reside underneath the bed
And if I was a hurt man
I'd find a way to put my faith
Into a woman that could take me from today
Maybe
I need somebody that could save me
From the parts of myself that keep making me crazy
And if I was a wise man
I'd climb to the top of the mountain peak
To think about strength versus weakness
I'd find a point that rests a couple of feet above your head
And figure out how I could try to help you reach it
(Ho ho ho)
And if I did have a choice
I'd never want to live forever
Just let me have a voice so I can make my points
I can't imagine running a race with no finish line
Just let me keep my pace and make to most of my time
I love giving but I'm bad at receiving
The truth is, I'd prefer to be the one bleeding
But I'm a paranoid that stays between play and work
Cautious and aware, 'cause I'm afraid of being hurt
Which brings me to the issue
And that would be this:
How often must I ask myself why I exist?
I feel like a freak, this world is a circus
Just trying to find myself as well as my purpose

This goes to those that own a mouth full of Sean's load
Thanks for starting, now you're barking down the wrong road
Sacrifice plays a part in grabbing mics
From now to the afterlife I'll continue passion-like
I love this fucking whore with all my heart
And ain't nobody gonna stop me from doing my part
It gave me life, it saved me life, it raised me right
So slide sholder slide and please hand over that mic
[chorus 2x]
Who am I? One of a kind, Send em' one at a time
You're all the same only separate by kick snares and names
And some of ya'll even share the same names
So fuck you and your lies baby, show no shame
So point a finger at the sucker that's having a good summer
Ain't got no bread, no need to know wonder
But I got the phone number to this weakness
I know who can put me back together, make me feel whole
So take me apart, try to break me down,
Spend all you got just to hate the clown.
You can fake the frown, imitate the sound
Underworld, world-wide, wide world of underground
It goes, one little, two little, three little indie rap
Headphones, backpacks watch em' all piggyback
Switch up my styles, they all complain
But see which kids next year sound the same as me?
The same shit yesterday was like today
Only difference is I trust even less of what you say
But all in all I still make the noise, I still break the toys, I still hate your voice
I still say fuck a major label till it limps,
Put your deal up our table and we'll show you who's the pimp.
There is no sympathy for the careless,
Fuck the extra credit and fuck the demerits.
Class dismissed.

I'm a slow typer, a so-so writer
Been the shit ever since I was an infant in diapers
And I'ma be dope, all the way to the end
From the cradle to the grave, the Pampers to the Depends
Get enough love, got enough friends
But on a regular basis it's safe to say I've got the benz
And I didn't mean to ignore that vibe you sent
I guess my mind was probably on my rent
Oh I got my mind on my tummy, and my tummy on my mind
Some assembly required, let me run it down the line
The factory is open, time card punched
Until lunch time it's crunch time, back to work
Fool, the first rule is to keep the verse true
Even if it hurts you, you gotta wear the pain like a stain
Respect the listener, respect the game
Because there's more to game than some dinner and fame

Give me the money
Don't you dare stop there
Give me the mic
That's the tool, and I play it cool
Give me the life
I've seen things that used to be dreams
Give me the love
My name's Slug, give me a pound or a hug
And I'ma play this game, I just want to say
All I really want is for you to remember my name
And I'ma run for as long as I'm allowed
And hope to God I inspire some of ya'll

See I'm that cat that used to sit in the back and study
Looking for some proof, that God loves ugly
Flash forward a decade later in your time
Somehow, a good number of ya'll got down
And it's solid, fresh, dope, whatever you want to call it
(Not back) An aspiring sociopathic alcoholic
(Ahh shit) Look at Slug still rockin' the same outfit
Tryin to make the belly grow bigger than the wallet
Ay yo man, how you doing, (what?), how you been?
Just been makin it cool to rap about love again
Not that hippie stuff I'm talkin 'bout that bitch that gives you nuts
Did he say bitch? Yeah I'm sorry, don't tell my baby's mommy
Speakin of baby, when done, there'll be a crate full of albums
For my son to page through, thinking daddy was a gun
With a handful of heads that put me up
til they had some samples from Ant, and faith in What the Fuck?
I said, still goin, still maintainin, still standing in the land of snow and purple rain
And I'm still waitin for my date to kiss me or slap me
Cause there ain't no way that I can be happy, when I'm half me

I've had the pleasure of speaking with some of you
Yeah you, come on now, don't act like you don't know who I'm talking to
After that show, when you approached me like you know me
The cd I sold you, the secrets that you told me
On that world you vision, through the layers of tears
The ones you choke and keep hidden when the players are near
I watch you chase it with beer, some frustration and fear
Try to figure out why the hell I came here
Well I don't know either, and I'm not ready to take a breather, neither
All I know is I'm still a believer
So you can beat me up, or you can beat me off
Pick a side, any side, and let me do my job, come on
If you've got a lot of love to give, but you don't know who to give it to
I'ma turn out the lights of the cigarette, and write a song about you
This one's for you.

Runnin from the law, not my favorite hobby
I'm relieved that I saw the speed trap before he saw me
I don't need another ticket, I've gotta collection in the glovebox
They make great souvenirs cause they weigh less than rocks
Man you better slow your roll, let the numbers get low
Like a 55 stroll to move past the patrol
Hope he don't already know about my top speed
Like the helicopter radar that caught me outside of Milwaukee
I'm still livin this life, tryin to escape the problems
Quick and quiet at night just like the insects and the goblins
It's the gas fumes,the fast food, yo its all of the above
It's meetin women for a weekend and fallin deep in love
As good as it gets, man its as bad as you make it
But ain't nuthin like bathin in a freezin river naked
And I really don't know much but I know enough to know
Now that I'm lost, I've never been so found... (so in touch)
Take this job and give it to someone else
Corn on the cob is better when its hot with melted butter on top
Could warm the soul, but this ones cold
Cause I stole it off the side of the road
I'm not a real thief, I don't steal more than I need
Everything I take I eat, I never do it for the greed
I'm just a gravel trail type of man
Pull the car behind the brush and get in touch with your farm land
So if you gotta healthy lookin garden in your backyard
I'll pull over to admire then I'll check for a dog
And if the areas clear I'll be back here tonight
Set dinner for one under the moonlight...

aright, now its time to get on with your life
loaded up the Ford, with all the rations supplies
And hit the road to fly the friendly skies
It's been about a month since I left St. Paulie Girl behind
punctured the heart but it was for her own good
left her sittin in the kitchen with the breakfast dishes
And gave a name to this distance that she never would've understood
roll the window down, got the sounds distortin
And I got my last paycheck and half a carton of Newports man
And I'm never gonna quit til I face my challenge
And I use your mathematics just to average my gallons
And if you buy my tape it puts worth on my odometer
10 bucks'll take me 300 kilometers
runnin from myself wont stop until I pop

Shrapnel...
I can't remember who asked me, but someone asked me
How long I thought that I would be allowed atop this trash heap
I didn't answer cause I'm tired of criticizing the masses
Inspired the support the devouring of the self
All the power to the people who dig potholes
Placed me in a glass case full of lost treasures and fossils
Got a right to be hostile, my love is gettin' gang raped
By an army full money hungry crocodiles
Quantity is up, market in a flood
But the party over here has never steered through this much love
I'll take the laughter, but I'd rather have the women
Who am I kiddin'? I'll be content with whatever I'm givin'
Work for food, rent, sex, money, or water
I don't know what else that you have to offer
Your first born daughter? No need, already got her
She came to the set hungry and left hot and bothered
My posse's full of women, computer nerds, and thugs
Much to my dismay, I'm none of the above.
Someday I'ma be the mack of the minute
And you were so damn good I'ma have to forget it
Listen to the mimic, it's almost on
Drink, till ya hit me with a tall potion
Think quick, how much more insult
Will it take for me to break your light bulb

Shards of pull cards scattered on the carpet
It's hard to breathe cause you wear a fitted target
Tug upon a choke chain, travel the cold rain(?)
Of course I've came to show you shrapnel

Check your mail, climb your ladder
Count the pieces you've managed to gather
Does it matter? What are you trying to achieve?
Let go of your throat if you're dying to breathe
And finally we've begun to make a little progress
Ain't a single dock in this river that can stop us
Lost in the mix like a feeble(?) over dub
Got me screaming at these shippin' till these people know what's up
Yeah Slug's back, but his collection of hub caps
Caught a buzzin' brought a notebook full of love raps
Open the pipes and tuck that voice in
I'ma sit on this corner and nibble on my poison
Baby once in awhile I find a reason to smile
But most the time it's spent deep in denial
It's all make believe, I want the cake to eat
But this lake's too deep, tryin' to stand on two feet
Wonderin' about the thunder runnin' through this blood
I try to keep my cool, but the hat fits too snug
Study the love, took my degree
Shoved it into a bottle, chucked it into the sea
Shrapnel...

Shards of pull cards scattered on the carpet
It's hard to breathe cause you wear a fitted target
Tug upon a choke chain, travel the cold rain
Of course I've came to show you shrapnel

vampires,2002,atmosphere,Hip-Hop,"I do believe in monsters, I call them officers
I know enough to know to keep an eye on how I talk to ya's
Some of y'all at peace, but even one to many
Still at peace and slumber for the reading of the beast,
There's no release, she keeps, and teaches no remorse
More resembling of a thief than a horse
Plans, long range, attached to some thangs
And an arm that's strong, watch the song when it change
Nothing's strange, cause you know before you saw it
It's all the same, there ain't no such thing as flawless
All I want is a little more security, a little more safety, a lot less uncertainty
Override the circuitry, the sun as she dies, recognize the urgency, uncover your eyes
When i turn on the lights, she vanishes high, and so that i can feel her essence in the air
Acknowledge the night stalker, and regard there is a hunter, hunting your mom she takes from the slumber
Summer ain't as hot as you think, more than the child, that wears the target for your teeth to sink
This world is a vampire, she eats her kids, let's hide the bodies under the bridge
This world is a vampire, she eats her kids, let's hide the bodies under the bridge
This country's a vampire, she eats her kids, let's hide the bodies under the bridge
This city's a vampire, she eats her kids, let's hide the bodies under the bridge
She lurks in the alleys, with a wrong reality
Allegiance, and honor, keep it all in the family
Consumes the young, the blind, deaf, and the dumb
Drains the vein, and puts them under the thumb
She's on the television, celebrate the status quo
Energy to push mute on the remote control
Break the beat, shatter the measures into pieces
All i've left is the breath, and the world i've put to pieces
It's difficult, to figure out who to fear, gettin older by the minute, younger by the year
Will the hunger disappear, metabolism slow, world domination is the goal
Now let's gather the kids, and take em out to the styx, teach em all how to live
Come, take my hand and walk with me, before the vampires lock down the twin cities
This world is a vampire, she eats her kids, let's hide the bodies under the bridge
This world is a vampire, she eats her kids, let's hide the bodies under the bridge
This country's is a vampire, she eats her kids, let's hide the bodies under the bridge

Whatta you mean what was my childhood like?
What difference does that make?
Yo, my childhood was messed up, so what?
Everybody's childhood was messed up.
This is the 90's, find me one person who had it right.
What's that got to do with me rhyming?
What's left?
[Slug]
Now when my mother died I had to take it in stride
There ain't no room for pride in watching your father cry
And dad made it until maybe a year later
When they found his suicide inside of a grain elevator
Got over it, I had no other offers or options
Thought about whether or not mom and pop was watching
Never bothered with caution, no time for fear
Saw my folks carry fear for most my early years
And I learned from it, turned numb and ignored the storm
A burning sun waiting for the world to plummet
Finished growing up under my uncle's roof
He taught me how to count all the way up to 100 proof
From watching him I learned how to gather nourishment
Living off the different women that he had to nurture him
And on the surface I became a normal pre-teen
More afraid of nuclear war than snake bites and bee stings
My best friend was my TV
Game shows and cartoons substituted for puppies, rainbows, and balloons
Now here I am, the shy type, and I think I'm doing alright
Considering what it was like living my life
[Chorus (repeated)]
It's nothing but sunshine
It's all sunshine
It's nothing but sunshine
[Slug]
Now it's been 17 summers since I've seen my mother
But every night I see her smile inside my dreams
When I was younger I didn't actually see the accident happen
But every night I see her smile as it shatters against the screams
I can only imagine Dad's internal reaction
Strain, inferno burning, bound in his brain
What's it take to make a man who owns acres of land
Abandon the family plan and drown himself in his grains
I'm glad I left that farm in Northern Minnesota
Where the time moves slower and the winters are colder
Became a city boy, where everybody acts like they older
Where they stick to themselves and keep a chip on they shoulder
26 years of age, no longer full of rage
I think it's safe to say I've turned a page on my childhood days
""Ay yo look Ma, I'm a productive member of society
When I'm drunk I make noise, but otherwise I live quietly""
And on the weekend I go back up north to reminisce
Remember what it was like pretending to be a kid
Late at night I walked the fields and lurk in the shadows
Getting even with life by murdering cattle
[Cow Skit]

It's nothing but sunshine

Now, when you come to apply for a job
Don't tell 'em you're homeless
'Cause I promise they won't hire you
And if they like your songs
Just nod your head and play along
Never tell 'em what inspires you
I bet my fans know me better than my friends do
Because my friends don't pay that much attention
The fans memorize every single sentence
Which makes them far too smart to ever start a friendship
I need to start writing pieces about other people's problems
'Cause strangers are starting to get worried
I'm in a hurry to try to slow the system down a bit
And find happiness before I hit thirty
OK, OK, I've said too much
I wear my heart on my sleeve
When all I need to do is write a hit
Somebody shoulda showed me how to shut up and breathe
'Cause there's a time and place to bite your lip
It goes peace to phobia
For the boots made for walking
Now if only Best Buy could break me off with a Walkman
Everything would be fine
I could spend time smiling
Instead of pulling a sad clown around this island
I've got no suggestions
Well, maybe one
Leave my type alone when you decide to touch that microphone
See, me and you
We're on different pages
We're in different stages
We've got different flavors
I'mma let you do your thing
Just as long as your thing
Ain't got a single thing to do with me and what I'm trying to bring
But if my name crosses your lips
You better guard your tongue
Pardon me, give me my respect, and keep it all in fun
If I had extra time I'd walk around and shake everybody's hand

I'm trying to beat the clock now
So I'm out, right after I rock this crowd
It goes: ola ola olaaa (yeah)
Ola ola olaaa [2x]
It goes: one two three four five
Six seven eight nine ten
And all I ever wanted out of live was rhymin'
Either from me or an innocent bystander
I wasn't that picky, just give it to me quickly
Whatever it takes, to cook these cakes
You wanna hear your voice but don't know nothing 'bout the breaks
And it's obvious you haven't found your place
Got me askin', 'Who is he?""
""How did he end up in my city?""
I'm the crocodile that the trucker tried to wrestle
I'm the main ingredient from yesterday's special
Close the hole and push that level
I'll chop the head off the devil and I'll throw it at you
And I'll be damned if I ever climb another tree
From here on, the squirrels and birds can come to me
From sun to sun and from sea to sea
(Girl, they call me Slug, do you wanna make love?)
Now all the leaders in the place, throw your hands in the air
All the feeders in the house, throw your hands in the air
All the thinkers here tonight, put your hands in the air
Anybody we forgot, you can stand there and stare
Yeah, you remember, tracksmart (?), off to a bad start
The way I used to carry got buried in the backyard
Caught between a scotch and a cinnamon Pop-Tart
The bell doesn't work, foo, you better knock hard
Line by line, I'm doing fine
Ideas on my mind for my time
Hail when my kind does leave behind
They'll find that I was the one that died trying
I would never trade the way I am for the way I'm not
My crew is kinda popular, we get to play a lot
And my son thinks that I am the coolest thing in the world
'Cause he's still too young to fall in love with girls

Nobody sees tears when youre standing in a storm
Abandoning the norm, and handling the harvest
Measuring the worth by the depth of the hardships
I welcome all the hatred you can aim at my name
I held on to the sacred ways of how to play the game
When the soldiers started runnin short on rations
I began tappin the egg, to spark the hatchin
Make it happen
And take this captain to the gallows
I keep steerin us into an area thats shallow
Talkin to my shadow, he advised me not to worry
He said i should plant my tree and let it rise out of the fury
So give me some light, a little love and some liquid
Im gonna creep through the night
And put a plug in the spigot
And when the water grows
And the dam starts to overflow

Take the microphone from his fist he doesn't know how to clutch
You wanna treat it like a playground?
Well we can joke about your take down
And let your pride get hurt when I tug on your skirt
Like ""Shut the fuck up! Professionals are tryin' to work.""
And to the people that don't feel us: Fuck em'
Don't need em', can't see em', never leave em', never loved em'
Stuff em' full of dick till the hole rips
And let em' know that's what they get for that ho shit
""Ooh my goodness, Slug went up and flipped his style
I haven't really heard a mac like this in a while""
Bullshit! Still broke and I still fake the smile
Go ahead and download my dick to a file
Yo, you heard Slug sing his songs about women
Like he must be a weak link, I know I can fuck with em'
For those who wanna ride, come on, climb aboard
I'ma be an asshole for as long as I'm exhorted
You either call my bluff or turn the volume up
And make noise for the women that swallow stuff
And put your hands up if you feel the music
Cause all that matters is ""The Bass and the Movement""

I have a friend here who needs to put the brakes on. He's getting old.
And if he could put the brakes on time, he'd be coo'
The brakes...the brakes...the brakes...the brakes...

Step, step, step, step, step, step off
You know you gotta get lost because you know your soft
Huh huh step, step, step, step, step, stepped on

You need to park that bitch and get a starter kit
You might as well hire me to come write your shit"

So put your hand up if you remember the Juice Crew
They don't make em' like they used to
This supposed to be the new school?
Your guns are aimless, songs are nameless
How long you been famous?
I claim this region 200 hundred-mile radius
Twin Cities' flavors RhymeSayers got the tastiest
And you can hate me, it's part of the territory
As long as you know it's impossible to ignore me
>From middle fingers to hugs, tofu to the drugs
The fights fist(?), might as well just take pictures of Slug
And live out your own life to the fullest
Why you starin' at my feet when you're standin' in this bullshit?
You could never learn how to ride a bike without balance
So what's the point of trying to grab the mic without talent
Go get your brakes looked at, you fuckin' fake hood rat
Wanna be the basement's greatest? Too late, already took that!
Father knows best, but Father knows stress
But Father needs love, a back rub, and some rest
Damn he could use a good home cooked meal
Been burnin' both ends since he broke the seal
Up, up and away, watch him take off
Give himself a little hell and quit the day job
And ignite the sunlight, tryin' to write about life
About face(?), break the fear, and you're here till the plight(?)

And I wish that I had something to say
That could wipe that smile right off of your face
Here take my hand pretend you know my name
And blame it all on the game, blame it all on the game

Cat's be walkin' into the spot like they own it
Wearin' a face that they should save for they opponents
With the shoelaces tied, you're(?yet?) too wasted to drive
Either way I've arrived to bless this place with my vibe
Yeah right, my vibe ain't even cool
I sit in the corner and drink until I slur and drool
The t-shirt says shoot pool, not people
Kill time, not life, grab the mic and let the beat go
(Beat go beat go beat go)
But that's good for me,
It's hard to hide a magic card when you wear a short sleeve
Force feed what I've got when they not hungry
Tryin' to replace everything that they ripped off from me
Below the tummy, and choke the dummy theory
Beat the point dead until these folks hear me clearly
Keep it all simple, a simplistic intricate(?)
Rebuild the robots with little hands and finger tips
Reprogram, a world full of slow jams
Grab the prize and clutch it tight with both hands
Why go ?? talk
Anyone that calls this fall off(?) can suck my balls off
I ain't goin' nowhere, I'm still here, right here
Same spot that I stood when you first woke up
The same guy that grabbed the mic and made your girl wanna fuck
The same MC still runnin' on an empty tank of luck
[Chorus]
And I wish that I had something to say
That could wipe that smile right off of your face
Here take my hand, pretend you know my name
And blame it all on the game, blame it all on the game
And I wish that I had something to say
That could wipe that smile right off of your face
Come here take my hand, pretend you know..know..know

(What's your name foo?)
Rappers steppin' to me
They wanna get some
But most of them should go and try to boost their monthly income
Speaking over beats is the only time I feel complete
I don't hear the weak and I don't fear defeat
So what you got?
Connect the dots, I'll raise the pot
Remove the blood clot from the brain of hip hop
The name remains in tip-top shape
I'm still the back rapper scapegoat in the aim of their hate
I came in late, took a chair in the rear
But my classmates were unaware how long I'd really been there
My peers have been held back for years, holding back the tears
Everybody knows our name like we was the cast from ""Cheers""
So here's to the good times, tonight is mighty special
So fasten your seatbelts, cause I'm gonna launch this vessel
Ain't gonna land until I'm bigger than Espo
And bigger than ecstasy and bigger than techno
[Chorus:]
I wanna bigger than Jesus and bigger than wrestling
Bigger than the Beatles and bigger than breast implants
I'm gonna be the biggest thing to hit these little kids
Bigger than guns, bigger than cigarettes
A few years ago an ex-girl of mine
Asked me to keep her name out of my rhymes
So I said this rhyme that I'm about to say
It came from the heart and it went this way:
Go to hell girl, you make me sick!
I hope your new boyfriend gets cancer in his dick
What the fuck makes you think I'd put your name on my record?
there, now I feel a lot better
You know what?
I ain't drank a forty since I became old enough to drink
Not caught up in what the fuck these people think
Cause when I die they're gonna find the missing link
But tonight I'm gonna vomit it in the kitchen sink
I'm suprised more of y'all don't get hit by cars
Missing your surroundings, staring at the stars
I'm lonely without a woman that wants to spar
That's why I spend so much time in these bars
Drunk poolside, screaming, ""Do or die!""
Looking at the water asking, ""Who am I?""
Saw my reflection, Yes! I'm super fly!
And as you can guess again, I'm too damn high
[Chorus]
(What'd they say to you?)
But they said, ""Drop dead.""
I can't, I got a lot left
More than just another arrogant, asshole pot-head
In the top ten, who you love to hear on tracks
Smiling for the camera while I surf upon your ear wax
This beer's flat and she kisses like a stripper
I'm coming to terms with my status as a drifter
Girl, I'm only in this town for one night
And these neon lights are keeping me distracted from my plight
I feel like a legend on a leash
Making an effort to break every piece that I can reach
Yeah, I got something to say, and even more to teach
But first let me scrape these feces from my cleats
Standing on the roof, complaining to the moon
The only time I tell the truth is when I'm naked in my bedroom
Soon I'm gonna reap the harvest of my struggles
But from now on, y'all can call me sluggles
[Chorus]
Bigger than Jesus
Bigger than wrestling
Bigger than the Beatles
Bigger than breast implants

No suprises I guess that's how it goes
Sits across from me in a booth in this dive
I contemplate how much more I can survive
But- I'm alive so I should be content
Then tell why the hell my whole world is bent
I was send to make and frustrate the population
Inbetween the alcohol and the copulation
What you callin' it
If you build it I will break it
What's wrong, how you doin'
Naa, save it
Gave a fraction of all I had to give
I guess I hold a grudge beacause you still got my rib, with cha
Beautiful eyes, and scrupulous lies
Now watch this circusclown run around in circles and try
Seems like all I get to eat is Hope
Girl if we got along better we'd be dope
Oh walls, they surround me
Lonliness has found me
And for as much as I complain
I'm lovin' it
And I only mention it so that I can rub it in
Wake up to the sunlike, shake off last night
Check what's left and try to get the rest right
Decision, splitting, headache, lifting
Symptoms, matching,
Mama was afraid of it
Knowledge of self ain't as evil as they made it
Call it what you want

But sometimes she wears a disguise- yes you do

and yesterday was like today
Woke up, got up, near eleven o'clock
butt naked except I was wearing my socks
and that's cool, 'cause most the time this floor is cold
stand up and stretch look around this mess
my place has been a cage since she left me
make my way to the kitchen, start the coffee
then dip to the bathroom, begin the triple-s
and wash the previous evening off me
now out the shower, get dry, shove a q-tip in my ear
well, what do we have here?
it appears as if a piece of me has got motivation
ain't nothin' wrong with a little morning masturbation
fresh, dressed like fifty cents
clean and awake now I'm ready to commence
spark up the caffeine and nicotine binge
and that's pretty much the pattern of how the day begins
and I write for an hour, maybe half hour more
then put on my shoes and grab my key for the door
put my headphones on for this world I ignore
trek down the street towards the record store
""hey, bro - how you doing, anything new today?""
""nah man, how you been? it's the same old same again""
well, then I'll be gone, friend, I'll see you around
then I'm out, destination uptown
in the summertime the women wear a lot of skin
and if I sit in one spot I can take 'em all in
sometimes I even talk, to see if I can make one grin
if not, yo, it's cool I ain't gonna take it personally
from Anne Landers, to Ani DiFranco to Orphan Annie
I love all women, but most of them just can't stand me
I don't know, maybe it's my hair or my clothes
""...or maybe she noticed that you was diggin in you're nose...""
either way it's okay, I wasn't tryin' to get laid
I just wanted to say ""I hope you have a great day""
and then she stopped with a smile that began to blush
""here, take my number, call me up, I'll come over and make you lunch""
I got up and headed down towards the book store
to check the titles, that my man Michael's got me lookin' for
my visit was short, 'cause I just couldn't feel
that cat behind the counter actin' like I'm here to steal
so I dipped back out into a cloud of tattoos
pierced body parts and colorful hairdos
and I questioned, did Babylon resemble this?
are we getting any closer to the end of the list?
a sensuous kiss, placed on apoco-lips
we teach them how to make a fist, but not to resist
and I'm wondering how'd we find this position
but people are people and I still love 'em, especially the women
onwards to the coffee shop, maybe Muddies for a refill and some
sociological studies
see the junkies, while they co-exist with the sobers
all the bugging of eyeballs, the shrugging of shoulders
and that's when I saw her, sippin' on water
I wanna kiss her mom just for having this daughter
excuse me miss, I don't mean to come across strong
but I've been waitin' a while and you've been taking too long
and she smiled and I began to blush
she asked if I'd like to go to the bathroom and make some love
and I got visions of us, and the mirror getting steamed
and that's the very moment I woke up from the dream
Woke up, got up, near eleven o'clock
butt naked except I was wearing my socks
and that's cool, 'cause most the time this floor is cold
stand up and stretch and look for my soul

and yesterday was like today
In tomorrow I see no promise
and yesterday was like today
In tomorrow I see no promise

Got em running round in circles for the re-spect
They need the gossip, but where's the logic?
Voices in the box guarantee a better product
So here I sit now, and watch em trip out
Trying to pick a finger to put upon what its about
But if there was a point, you would still avoid
You should've taught the boys and girls how to take apart their toys
I stay up-set,with all the pup-pets
submerged in the drama 'cause they love it
That if they can hold the pain, and then they complain
Why would you chase away the sun if you don't want the rain?
I never asked for the world, just a portion
Tryin to make a good soldier out of daddy's little orphan
But management called down, demanded that we turned the sound down
And with that, I suggest we start the count-down
Simplistic spiral and work your way backwards
'Til the bastards collapse and choke on their last words
And I'll be back when its happy hour

overanxious, the goods will get damaged
Girl, how many stories can you fit into a tanktop?
How many wishes get spent on what you ain't got?
The youth want truth, well thank god
Tryin to keep it movin, while you're sittin in the same spot
Been in this cage for a long time (long time)
Been coverin this page with the wrong rhymes (wrong rhymes)
Got a strong mind, I got a weak will
I've got bad nerves and I can't keep still
But I stay humble, so when the meek take the planet
I can get a little piece with my name on it
The only problem is by then I won't want it
I'm in the backyard praying and hoping for the comet
Are you lookin to remember or searchin for adventure?
I guess it all depends on the agenda
Do you carry a grudge? Do you carry a gun?
I guess it all depends on where you come from
Surroundings are gonna dictate the needs
I'm out, I want to live around lakes and trees
And I'll be back when its happy hour
So just pour me another and ignore me my brother

she said she's 21 and quit school to go work for the man
A switch up in the plan, now she's happy as a chorus
'cause now she makes rent and now she drives a Taurus
Unwindin and hangin out at the bar
I wonder if she knows that I'm not really a star
She seems to be impressed with my lack of an ego and
my self-aware style, I like the way that she smiles
She want to know how I find the words I use
I don't really know but I can lie if you want me to
Angels sing to me in my sleep
I sold my damaged soul for the magic of speak
Now she's laughin, she likes the sarcasm
Naturally, I'm askin if she's got a captain
A captain? You mean a man at home? The answer is no
I came to this bar alone
Well heaven's to Betty, enough about boyfriends already
just tryin to keep the conversation petty
As much as I would love to run and play in the forest
ain't no way this girl is gonna break into my fortress
I've never made a practice, of introducing the mattress
to women that I meet at my own gig
I don't know, can't imagine anything as small as
alcohol and hormones turning out to be anything big
Baby's hella beautiful, even kinda bright
I've got the fire of a vampire inside me tonight
It might be alright, everything seems tight
I've got a good buzz and she's giving me the green light
So tell me girl, what you doin after?
She says hopefully hangin out with my new favorite rapper
Now wait a minute, that's not fair, you're throwin boulders
I can tell by the way your hair touches your shoulders
Be straight with me and I'll be mean with you
I can think of some of us that we should do
So if you think I'm coming home with you tonight
you're probably right(probably right)

A paradise, a parody, the hair police have got what you need
For you to get over me and move on with Godspeed

If I wasn't so conditioned to just take what I'm given
Get it, got it, catch it, caught it, and lost it
Yet I can't stop it, it's embedded in my optics
Plus the frustration is a product of the gossip
If you can't walk away can you at least change the topic?
Overextended the amount of time allotted
Broke the engine, I don't know, cracked the block
Now I'm standin' at this gravel roadside festival

I cant figure out why I'd give a damn to what she wants
I dont understand the now before the then
Most of this garbage I write
That these people seem to like
Is about you
And how I let you infect my life
And if they got to know you
I doubt that they would see it
They'd wonder what i showed you
How you could leave it

If I stay around, im bound to break resistance
Fuck you lucy for defining my existance
Fuck you and your differences
Ever since I was a young lad
With a part time dad
It was hard to find happiness inside of what I had
I studied my mother
I digested her pain
And vowed no woman on my path would have to walk the same
Travel like sound across the fate ladder
I travel with spoon to mix this cake batter
And i travel with feels so i can deal with touch
Its like that

They can peel pieces of me off the grill of her truck
Used to walk with luck
Used to hold her hand
Fell behind and played the role of a slower man
I wanna stand on top of this mountain and yell
I wanna wake up and break up this lake of hell
I feel like a bitch for letting the sheet twist me up
The last star fighter is wounded time to give it up
On a pick it up mission
Kept it bitter
Getting in a million memories just to forget her
The difficulty in keeping emotions controlled
Cookies for the road
Took me by the soul
Hunger for the drama
Hunger for the nurture
Gonna take it further
The hurt feels like murder
Interperate
The eyes
Read the lines on her face
The sunshine is fake
How much time did i waste?
Fuck you lucy for leaving me
Fuck you lucy for not needin me
I wanna say fuck you
Because i still love you
No, im not ok

Well I guess im a little pissed
Every action has a point
Five points make a fist
You close em
You swing em
It hurst when it hits
And the truth can be a bitch
But if the boot fits
I got an idea
You should get a tatoo that says warning
Thats all, just a warning
So the potential victim
Can take a left and safe breath
And avoid you
Sober and upset in the morning
I wanna scream Fuck you Lucy
But the problem is i love you Lucy
So instead
Ima finish my drink,and have another

party-for-the-fight-to-write,2002,atmosphere,Hip-Hop,"[Intro:] This is one of those songs you can clap along too...
[Slug]
Hides the eyes beneath the bill of the cap
Walks amoungst the flies that hover over the mat
He lies, but only when there's a reason
Measures life by the tragedy, the comedy, the season
Poor at handling and managing income
Got enough love to pass around and then some
Been done, that there a name you can trust
Read the whole match book and put a flame to the brush
Good with pets, and rips up sets
Put the show in biz, try to give what you get
When you let him run free with the thought
Pull the line in, try to see what you caught
I ain't all that bad, but I ain't all that great
I Went back to the lab and began to mutate
Wait. I still look the same, still got the same dumb name
Ain't a damn thing changed
But if you like surprises, I know of a party
Where they all dance around to your heart beat
Bring your own agenda and embrace your flaws
Lets put a face on this common cause
[chorus:]
And he said some got pencils and some got guns
Some know how to stand and some of them run
We don't get along, but we sing the same song
Party for the fight to write, and write on
Stay gold Pony Boy, stay true outspoken
Make a record Mr. Gangster and get 'em all open
With the theories, the stories, the truths, the myths
Its all therapy, on top of turntable riffs
This indutry's big, so big in fact (and fat?)
We can all get some, and we can give some back
And if its done correct, we'll make more than noise
So pick it up, and pick me up when you're bored with the toys
As a child Hip Hop made me read books,
And Hip Hop made me wanna be a crook
And Hip Hop gave me the way and something to say
And all I took in return is a second look
Son, you're shook, 'cause ain't no such thing as half way there
Gettin' good at actin' like you just don't care
The circle of life trying to make it square condition
And self sit still
And Still.. where have all the sheep gone
Burnt down the farm and turned the TV on
John Coltrine, Marvin Gaye and Bob Marley all get invitations to my party
[chorus]
And if I spent anymore time inside my head
I'd probably need some leather straps attatched to my bed
And if I go another day without eating a meal
I'm gonna show you what it means to keep it real
And if they keep shootin' guns up and down my block
I Swear to God I'll be the first one to call the cops
And if I gotta hear that song ever again
You gonna have to share some of that beer my friend
They mistake me as happy-go-lucky
Just another base-head bobbin' nobody
But from where I stand, they sould like spies
Fillin' all the children's head with lies
Well alright, get your money right
But right now tonight I want you to pick a side
So when you got your power and you got your chedder
Let's get together soldier over throw this hold and make these roads better
(Bring it on.. he said bring it on right now) [X2]
Ain't nothin' but a party y'all... lets get it on
[chorus X2]"
liquor-lyles-cool-july,2003,atmosphere,Hip-Hop,"Keep movin' your body in my direction
Let's continue our party everybody by just clapping our hands
Colossal, large, big as it gets, massive
I'd kill you all if I wasn't so passive
Instead I creep off to a booth and hold it solo
To study these people, you fuckin' filth
Walkin' on my fifth or maybe my sixth
Where every women represents the meaning of existence
I've no choice but to notice the one that consistently keeps me enlisted
Keeps me aware, she has no idea where my head sits
And if she did, how do you think she'd react?
Maybe double up and laugh, maybe catch some relief
Place wagers on the theories, keep your eye on my trap
Emotions speak through me in the form of gratuity
Is this enough? Is there an underlying message?"
national-disgrace,2003,atmosphere,Hip-Hop,"[Slug]
(I pledge allegiance to Budweiser and free drugs)
Peace to Rick James, Anna Nicole Smith, Bill Clinton
And Motley Crue
And anyone else who has ever utilized their 15 minutes
Of fame to realize their true dreams of being an
Absolute jerk off, just to keep the masses entertained
This goes out to learning from the mistakes of others
Bring it on now
Come on
I said come on
I said come on
[Verse 1]
They call me a jerk, once they get to know me
But they don't stop calling, they read me well
It's no work if I was phony, I'd win a trophy
Who needs to make records when there's seeds to sell
Freak the bell, and make it all spin crooked
God please help, too much grim to look at
Grab the tree by the limb and shook it
Like, ""Have you seen my self esteem, where the hell'd you put it?""
Oh wait, never mind, I found it in a bottle
Drunk at the Troubadour talking to a model
Wrecked the rental on Santa Monica Boulevard
I was headed to the El Rey to slap a security guard
[Chorus]
Rowdy, stubborn, loud and arrogant
As American as apple pie and embarrassment
Package the kid's face, put it on display
Look ma!, another national disgrace
Dumb and ignorant, drunk and belligerent
Open up your heart y'all, come on and let me in
Package the kid's face, put it on display
Look ma!, another national disgrace
[Verse 2]
The liquor gets hold of the head liver's soul
Blurry on Sixth Street and Red River Road
Last thing I remember was the Ogden Theatre
Backstage bathroom making out with all three of ya
Kicked out of Topcats... for where I put the vomit at
Finally passed out in a laundry mat
Malnourished and topless, slurring and obnoxious
Like, ""Yo, we got this!""
The Zodiac Killers 'bout to rock this
At the Great American Music Hall, pissin on the box office
Pick apart the detail, alcohol and females
All around the world same song
Houseton and Ludlow, Maxfish, Vampire
You poor the beer and I'll bring the satire
No prob, I'll play the part of doorknob and make it look
So good you're gonna wish that it was your job
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
It's all about the hangovers, and late checkouts
Maid banging on the door like, ""Wake up! Get Out!""
But Come on mami, y'all probably don't want me comin'
Out like a Zombie brushing teeth in the lobby
This is a career, not a hobby
Ain't no reason to fear what you wanna see
Hey paparazzi, don't you wanna watch me quote the
Fonzi and then crash his Mazaradi?
Sweat pants, t-shirt, mesh hat, blue blockers
Feeding Jack D. to a room full of teenie boppers
Howdy neighbor, take a shot for flavor
Let's debate whether or not we should punch the waiter
I'm just kidding, let's love each other
It goes lick, swallow, suck, and order another
Do what you like, don't nobody care
It's a sign of success only in America

[Chorus End: 4x]
I didn't cooome to start no trouble or hurt no one

shoes,2003,atmosphere,Hip-Hop,"[Slug]
Would you prefer if I remove... MY... UHH?
Nah they.. they clean..
I mean.. what?
You wanna look at the bottom of...?
My shoes are clean girl, how about yours?
Here we are sitting on your living room floor
Listening to some records from your collection
Boredom; in between a coma and an erection
Staring at the skin on your shoulder blades
And you don't take your eyes off my poker face
I'm wasted, and your as sober as Jehovah
Knocking door to door, trying to walk to road
That the Mormon's paved
If she was here on your sofa with a beer on a coaster
She'd of told 'ya that my game was way over played
Make no mistake
I love the way you taste like yogurt and some clover cigarettes
Girl show me leg!
So I'ma gonna trade these shoes for rollerskates
And I'ma stay happy just as long as there is a whore to pay
But some of us already spent the rent
So we can't be content until there isn't no more today
[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Those are your shoes
These are my shoes
We've got issues
My shoes are muddy girl, how about yours?
Here we are loungin' on your bedroom floor
I'm really drunk so I'm looking at your carpet like
Man, fuck the permit, I know where I'ma park tonight
It's closing time, the spins are gonna visit me
They're rolling thick like they know they taking victory
But not tonight, right, I'ma make some history
Get up in your system and direct it like a symphony
Let me get to be the man of your mystery
'Cause them meddeling kids don't understand your sensitivity
Show some sympathy
Let me kiss your feet
Let's talk about a pretty bird and a busy bee
If I live to see fifty, I'ma be a tipsy, dirty old man
Still following my kid beliefs
I know it isn't really your responsibility
So we'll be strait once I take a hit of Listerine
[Chorus]
I can't find my shoes girl, how about yours?
Here I am naked on your bathroom floor
I got faded, and you fell asleep
And I'm thanking God that this date was hella cheap
Sitting down, trying to keep the liquor down
Light, stars and sounds everything flickers now
Sick bound, the whole room twists around
In front of the toilet assume the position to drown
Here it comes! Whiskey out bounces all over the floor
Now I'm sitting in the bitches mound
I'm just a clown and I'm sorry I found it funny
When you tripped over my shoes and hit the ground
Didn't know you would rip your gown
Didn't think you would shout and get so loud, get so wound
Yeah I'm drunk, but I'm more than a little proud
I'm leaving, fuck the shoes you keep them, I'm getting out

Perfection [repeat 4X]"

Hey you fucking asshole
Hi Sean, I just got finished cleaning some vomit out of my car
Sean, I'm so fucking pissed at you I could rip your goddamn arms off and..
Anyways, I don't care, I don't wanna fucking talk to you
I don't wanna talk to you anymore
I don't know what your deal's been lately, but I fucked you like 15 times
And you just take and take
and you just fuck everyone over in the end anyways
Okay and number 2, being fucked up
is not an excuse to piss in the goddamn fish tank
I'm sick of your bullshit. I'm sick of you acting like you can just fuckin..
Leave a trail of destruction and shit
everytime I'm around you and I'm fucking tired of it
It's just not cool, my roommates told me
what the fuck you did after you got stupid drunk as usual
I don't ever want you in my fucking house
in my fucking car, anywhere near me
It's fucking over, I don't want to talk to you anymore
I don't want to think about you anymore, I don't ever want to see you again
Even if you don't care, you can never ever come into my house again
Fuck me? Fuck you. Rot in fucking hell
Fuck you, go fuck yourself
You should care, if you give a fuck at all (?) you'll call me
Hear me out, don't come fucking crying to me when your world falls apart and
you have nowhere to turn, alright? Have a good day
...Already? Already? Already? What'd you call 'em?

I can't imagine some of the things that you've seen
City to city with no spot to sleep
I know she will run with opposable thumbs
She's trying to overcome all of the maniacs(?)
Coast to coast, who knows the most?
Age before beauty, sleep before scrutiny
Who could it be now, here she comes
With an eve(?) of her tongue and the games that she runs
Little girl dolls(?) never get lost, pay the cost, embrace the flaws
Let her get tossed in the back of a mid-size
Trying to look at life through those kid's eyes
""Jackpot"", that's in quotes
Sometimes you gotta let go if you wanna get votes
But fuck the votes, I spin towards the clouds
A bullet in your head sits still allowed
I used to pretend that I gave a fuck
Now a do give a fuck, a little too much

jason,2003,atmosphere,Hip-Hop,"Such a pleasure to come home
'cause I...I have a very special love for this city
Well all right, well okay [x3]
Well all right [x3]
I wanted to make a song about where I'm from
You know? Big up my home town, my territory, my state
But, I couldn't figure out much to brag about
Prince lives here, we got 10,000 lakes
But wait, the women are beautiful, to me they are
And we're not infested with pretentious movie stars
And it hit me, Minnesota is dope
If only simply for not what we have but what we don't
It's all fair, it ain't out there, it's in there
It's in the mirror, behind the breast under the hair
Follow the dream doesn't mean leave the love
Roam if you must, but come home when you've seen enough
I love New York and Cali, but I ain't movin'
Too overpopulated saturated with humans
And I'm not big on rappers, actors, or models
If I had to dip, I'd probably skip to Chicago
None of this is to diss no one, nowhere
Like damn, I'm from Minnesota, land of the cold air
Too many mosquitoes and our fair share of egos
But like my man Sabe says, that's where my mommy stays
[Chorus:]
So if the people laugh and giggle when you tell em where you live
Say shhh, say shhh
And if you know this is where you wanna raise your kids
Say shhh, say shhh
If you're from the Midwest and it doesn't matter where
Say shhh, say shhh
If you can drink tap water and breathe the air
Say shhh, say shhh
Got trees and vegetation in the city I stay
The rent's in the mail and I can always find a parking space
The women outnumber the men two to one
Got parks and zoos and things to do with my son
The nightlife ain't all that, but that's okay
I don't need to be distracted by the devil every day
And the jobs ain't really too hard to find
In fact, you could have mine if you knew how to rhyme
This is for everyone around the planet
That wishes they were from somewhere other than where they standin'
Don't take it for granted, instead take a look around
Quit complaining and build something on that ground
Plant something on that ground, dance and sleep on that ground
Get on your hands and knees and watch the ants walk around
That ground Make a family, make magic, make a mess
Take the stress, feel your motivation and build your nest
It sucks that you think where I'm from is wack
But as long as that's enough to keep your ass from coming back
And with a smile and a hint of sarcasm, he said
""I beg your pardon but this is my secret garden""

If the playground is clear of stems and syringes

If there's only one store in your town that sells 12-inches

Look at your face
When all I could see was myself looking back at me
Reflection
And all I could do was think about sleeping next to you
[Slug]
What would it take to make a women like you
You a wolf like me for what I really might be
Listening to the lyrics only heres what I allow
You gotta try and make me testify for here and right now
Lets have a confrontation over a cold one
I'll give you conversation just to see if you can hold em
I play so dumb
Because I know some of these star struck small talk art fucks is no fun
I'm the blood type that goes straight for the guns
Like before you even spoke already knew what your loves like
So what you thinking?
Because I'm thinking we should jump into your ocean
Let's go girl this ship is sinking
[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Look at your face
When all I could see was myself looking back at me
Reflection
And all I could do was think about sleeping next to you

Now there's no reason to lie, I've had a lot of lovers
In my reality its impossible to avoid it
But theres one reason for life gotta provide some supper
Gonna build a family just to watch some one destroy it
Do you really think you really wana get to know me better
Don't you see the drama
Don't you feel the pressure
Don't get me wrong it would be my pleasure
To sing a song that could remove your shoes and your sweater
Bartender let me get a shot of bean
Cause this girl over here is trying to get me out my jeans
And she doesn't seem to believe i'm just another thief
Came to take a piece and make you stutter when you breath
Now girl you to smart to be a tour mark
Set to play correct from the start with your pure heart
And when your all alone ill sing into your phone
If you don't know the words you can make up your own
The first time she met the devil was at first avenue
Went back stage with him into the dressing room
Sexy ego trip
Taller than expected
About six foot three
Seemed to thrive on his misery
Critical observant big words
Sweaty hair sunken eyes and thick nerves
She said ill make em smile for the simple fact that he needs it
I'll make him smile just so I can kill it an eat it
You look like you were built for me
You talk like you want to steal my drink
You kiss like you already came
And that's a lift to pull a line for those with out any game
It's like damn baby
You know you can't save me
But you should still tell your people that your leaving with the band
Maybe you can show me your hustle
Neither one of us would be so lonely
If only you would come over here and hold me
I caught you trying to hide your smile behind your glass
But all of your secrets become a swing set when you laugh
And all of your regrets that you're carrying a burying
Don't mean a damn thing if there's nobody to share them with
We've been following each other all night now
We ought to be all over each other like right now
I don't like crowds lets take flight now
Cause that face that you make
Reminds me of my life now
[Chorus: repeat 6X]
Look at your face
When all I could see was myself looking back at me

To emo kids that got too many feelings
He held the register open while he counted her change
I was next in line which meant I was invisible
From where I stood I could see that the till was full
He didn't look the type to play superhero
So I stepped forth and paid for my cigarettes
Crept out the stores front door to chase a little breath
Bangles in my head, shake the song off
Another manic Monday night, its gonna be a long walk
A car pulled up, a fixed up Cutlass
A woman and a child climbed out and left it running
They went inside of the deli, placed an order
With the extra dollar fifty bottled water 'cuz the daughter's
picky
When they came out mommy gave me a glance
That said, man can love an angel but he's got to take the chance
Already knew the deal, I lit one up and walk,
So they got back in the Oldsmobile, belted up, and took off.
Thug love on the corner by the Walgreen's
Looking at me like I'm just another square saltine
As I get closer I notice that they showing each other sketches
Out of their notebooks, reminded me of my old roots
I walk pass with a nod and a reminisce
Swear to God hip-hop and comic books was my genesis!
Respect the life and the fashions of the children
It's the only culture I've got, exactly what we've been building
All of a sudden I'm in front of some man
No he's a young'in but he's got a gun in his hand
He looks fifteen, he looks frantic, no he looks afraid
Immediately apprehensive 'til I heard him say
""Do you want this? It's not mine, I promise!
I found it on my block in between a couple garages!
Didn't wanna leave it for a child to stumble over!
I don't even know how to hold it!""
It was a thirty-eight, the poor man's machete
Held it in my hand, thinking damn man it's heavier then
expected,
wedged it behind my belt buckle
knowing that it's evil, even thought that I could smell trouble
the extra strength felt weak,
but over there on the corner saw what I needed and proceeded to
cross the
street
put the heat in the mail box to loose it
figured that the post office knows what's best to do with it
Mosey down the road thinkin' 'bout the old,
I used to roam this zone with two feet of snow
Right here, this used to be a record shop
I've gotten love, I've gotten drunk, I've gotten beat up in that
parking lot.
I've had my Lake Street pride for three decades
These alleyways, and these streetlights have seen my best days
Before I was a germ learning how to misbehave,
All the way to the grave, South Side is my resting place
Took a right on Lyndale, I'm getting near
But then the road became empty and the people disappeared.
The clouds ran away, opened up the sky
And one by one I watched every constellation die
And there I was frozen, standing in my backyard
Face to face, eye to eye, staring at the last star
I should've known, walked all the way home
To find that she wasn't here, I'm still all alone
No matter where I am, no matter what I do,
I'm always coming back home to you.
They can leave me for dead, they can take away my true,
I'm always coming back home to you.
Through the lies and the sins that ride the wind that blew,
I'm always coming back home to you.
As sure as the life in the garden that you grew,
I'm always coming back home to you.
No matter where I am, no matter what I do,
I'm always coming back home to you.
If only I had known what you already knew,
I'm always coming back home to you.
From the heaven I've had to the hell I been through,
I'm always coming back home to you
I wanted to make a song about where I'm from

Big ups my hometown

We travelin the missle, weavin' through your cornfields
Leavin behind a trail of amature porn and orange peels
Navagatin through this basement, the mascarades
As our nation, practicin' my acetate, masturbation
Watchin the expressions on the faces
Of the ones designated to be the queens, kings, and aces
How many miles can you put on one soul
Before the smile starts to blend into one big bullet hole
[Brother Ali]
Shoot through it as a union, with the best of my crew
Bumpin melodys and memories too, my heads killin me, ohh
Stomach empty, my bladder is full
Two year old son on Jay Birds phone Cryin, ya missin me
And I'm starvin', I'll bite ya arm off
Sabertooth Tiger, run the night with the sharp claws
In ya backyard just to fuck with ya guard dog
Throw a brick through your shit and cut the alarm off
Bitch

Fuck yes, I do my best to take advantage in bouts
With one hand over the mouth, still managin' to shout
Theres more said, then in the lines in your forehead
Then could ever find in fine print on the inside of that warhead
Cross counrty, like a little lost junky
Make them hot and jumpy, trying to get that God money
Stearin the van through the blizzards, the fanfare
Pivot when we visit, spit victim if you stand there
[Brother Ali]
Take a map of this picture, throw a dart at it, thats where
We took a room back full the kids and threw a heart at it
Angry like a hostage, Kickin like a little bitch in one of Dibs's mosh pits
Shifitin through your city limits tryin to find the raw shit
Thread and needle wit it, and weave a world of hate together, till we get
'em car sick
Face full of war paint, strapped ready for action
Battle cracks headin, trying to seek the satisfaction of the captain
[Slug]
Climbed over the side, closed his eyes
Took a dive into his fame, inspiration for stayin alive
Swam to the shore, stepped upon land
Walked up to a whore, grabbed her by the hand
And said
[Chorus]

Let the wheels spin, let the road shake
Let the speakers blow
Let the line in, let the kids play
Let the people know
Let the roof burn, let the girls love
Let the heat flow
Let the world turn, let the curtains up

Lock eyes, with a thousand people at the same time
They minds, believin this, my style of graffiti is
Squeezin just, the mid west, sweat out of my shirt
And leavin with my life lessons embedded in ya dirt

We work, move, and hustle with the rest of the Gypsies
Spoon feed these issues to a new school of Fishies

The finest imperial wordsmiths on the circuit
Two Million smiles and runnin, stompin', trying to flee the heat
Turn around, shootin at the monster till his knees are weak

Hi, my name is Sean Daley and you might know me from such films as
""I Can't Sing, But Neither Can You.""
Haha yea, heheheh what are you lookin' at?
Don't look at me, don't even talk to me
Oh you rap too? Heheh I should've known
I ca, I can tell. Nah, it's in your eyes
Just cause you're an emcee doesn't mean that you get to be an asshole (asshole)
Just cause you're a man, doesn't mean you get to act like a bitch (like a bitch)
Won't you stand over here do a favor use your head to hold this apple (apple)
And on my twenty pace take, aimin' shots, swear to God I won't miss (I won't miss)
See I've been around the world without moving and I've met a lot of people (people)
And they all play the same little games the only change is the date (is the date)
It's all fame and respect a little money won't you help me build my ego? (ego)
Without taking any time to think about how it might affect fate (checkmate)
You see we've come a long way just to find that there ain't no place to lay down
[break down]
And we waited all night for the light, but the dawn never broke (never broke)
And if we let the song play we can lead all the children to the lake now (take down)
Because it seems as if most would rather choose to sit back and let 'em choke
(don't choke, don't choke)
Just cause you're an emcee doesn't mean that you get to be an asshole (asshole)
Just cause you're a man, doesn't mean you get to act like a bitch (you bitch)

They love the taste of blood
Now I don't know what that means, but I know that I mean it
Maybe they're as evil as they seem
Or maybe I only look out the window when it's scenic
""Atmosphere finally made a good record.""
Yeah right, that shit almost sounds convincing
The last time I felt a sinking contradictive as this
Was the last time we played a show in Cinnci'
""Get real."" they tell me
If only they knew how real this life really gets
They would stop acting like a silly bitch
They would respect the cock whether or not they believed in it
Doesn't take much and that's messed up
Because these people do a lot of simple shit to impress us
While everyone was trying to out-do the last man
I was just a ghost trying to catch some Mrs. Pac-Man
Hello ma'am, would you be interested
In some sexual positions and emotional investments
See, I'm not insane, in fact I'm kind of rational
When I be askin', ""Yo, where did all the passion go?""
East coast, West coast, down South, Midwest
Nowadays everybody knows how to get fresh
Somebody give me a big yes (YES!)
God Bless America, but she stole the B from ""Bless"" (Accept it)
Now I'm too fucked up to dance
So I'ma sit with my hand down the front of my pants
You can't achieve your goals if you don't take that chance
So go pry open that trunk and get those amps (You know!)

Treat me like a God, oh they treat me like a leper
You see me move back and forth between both

So now I keep a close eye on my pets
Because they make most of they moves off of instinct and sense
It's eat, sleep, fuck in self defense
So straight you can set your clocks and place bets
Wait, let's prey on blind, deaf, dumb, dead
Hustle, maybe a couple will love what you said
Emcees drag their feet across a big naked land
With an empty bag of seed and a fake shake of hands
Yeah I got some last words, FUCK ALL OF YA'LL!
Stop writin' raps and go play volleyball
Gotta journey the world in a hurry
Cause my attorney didn't put enough girls on the jury
Guilty of droppin' these bombs in the city
But I'm innocent, love is the motive that's why you're killin 'em
Guilty of settin' my fire in all fifty
But I'm innocent, blame it on my equilibrium
[Chorus x2]
In the days of Kings and Queens I was a jester
Treat me like a God, oh they treat me like a leper
You see me move back and forth between both

I'm trying to build a balance
I gotta find my balance

It's either one thing or another

Probably know both of my brothers
The one is a hard workin' savior
The other's a hard workin' soldier

Or so he thought
Paid attention to the lessons that he taught
Second hand me down blessing
She was short on patience
Carried person hated every day people
The plight of the pessimist
Habitual living daily schedule consisted of work
Television and sexual moments
But some times it gets so hope less
When non-sense raises an oct of thought blocks
With a firm grasp on the grudge they both clutched in the name of love
Fear of the results had push ever came to shove
Seduced for fun
Produce a a lot of fight
Two youths on the run
Learning some truth about life
And when he stares at the stars he reflects on the moon
The time the talks they share walking around calhoon
And when she watches the look on his face as he sleeps
She recalls every inch as to how it got this deep
Now how am I to know you like the way I laugh
I can't read the map, no ones ever seen the path?
The one you take a bath with is the same on the freeze your path
Oh you going out? what time you goin be back?
Cause they were two perfect kids
In a two perfect worlds
Today the part of man and women will be played by boy and girl
Lets all take seats
Please quiet during the performance
Lift her pull her from the orchids
Trying to read the script but keep getting trapped in the margins
Lift them pull them from the gardens
Your horoscope says we should share an apartment
Lift them pull them apart from their gardens
Now she was smart
She grew up with this complex
That the people that surrounded her seemed to expect the world
And he was tall over six no attempt to predict the fall
Though he'd seen it all
Until his all became that girl
She said she loves the drugs
But when she comes down
She speaks about finishing
She's convinced its the last visit
He doesn't know the difference between come and go
Just give him one to grow and watch him collapse inside of a half pivot
She died her hair black
Maybe now she can relax
Maybe now the regulars will stare half as hard
He wears a old face and beer gut
Existence validation printed on the monthly statements
That comes from master card
He thinks she sleeps to much
She thinks he spends to much
He thinks her friends are jokes
She thinks he's out of touch
He thinks she drinks to much
She think he thinks to much
Its all another phase turning the page in the book of growing up
She's has seen a lot of sex
He tried to hide his resentment
But their wasn't nothing thing left for them to label new
But sometimes the obvious ain't simple to see
Cause even the time that they killed
Wasn't something that she wasnt accustomed too
She never comprehended what to make of it
He was never quite prepared to study the reaching
Together they shared the sacred practices of breathing
The weather was fair how ever the hovering clouds weren't leaving
Discover the little drama demons that hide deep inside the frame work
And live in That congested brain
They had old lovers on the side old flames
That some how managed to spark regardless of the pouring rains
And each time they mixed up the ingredients
They'd recheck the recipe to see maybe they written it incorrectly
Collect me consume me release me snuggle
Two geniuses putting together the pieces to a blank puzzle
Every time I chase a squirrel it rips apart my world
Every time I chase a squirrel it rips apart my world
Every time I chase a squirrel it rips apart my world
And every time I chase a squirrel it rips apart my world"

let me get a warm welcome from... more importantly Denver)
(Nothing I say, nothing I say, my mistake to you)
Here I am alone in an airport bar
Why, just cause I don't own a car
Its valentines day, I'm returning home from Berkley
Aint a damn thing that y'all can do to hurt me
Unsober, laid over in Denver
The waitress could smell it the minute I entered
There's seven shells losing their souls in here
Sporadically placed amongst scotch and beer
But there's one woman in the back left corner
Who looks like she could really use the support
If I could only muster the strength to be a friend
Who knows how this adventure could end
Bend me up, slip me the tongue, shoot me down
Cut me loose, bury me, and piss on the ground
Felt the water, but sober it's over y'all
Don't know if I can get down for too much longer
Everywhere I go I find at least one
And I bet it won't die till the travel is done
For as long as I learn my heart hope to god
Up to the side of my head ride and die for the young
(Nothing I say, nothing I say, my mistake to you)
[Refrain]
It's the sound of emotion enough
To make me wanna hang myself from the rafter that's over my bed
But when I stop to climb the ladder that's embedded in my heart
I start to question all the emotion in my head

To all the depressed women in the house
Whether you're taking the Prozac the Xanax or the Paxil
Whatever the hell they put into that capsule
I want y'all to come up to the front of the stage
And grab me a shot of something along the way
Put a smile on the front of your head
Got a thing for the women that don't love themselves
So either loosen up your hair or tighten up your belt
And this time, this time is a good time
For good times
You know why she's sitting by the window
She's waiting for her prince to come
And here I am on the opposite side of the room
Trying to pretend that I'm not that dumb
It goes older bold and full of cold
But did I mention that it's well deserved?
No let's make a mess,
No let's make a baby,
No let's make some hell on earth
Do you mind if I turn out the lights?
If I'm going to be alone I'd rather do it in the dark
So I stare at half of a beer half wishing that the transmission would stay in park
She keeps the music down, so her neighbors don't complain
Keeps the drama up
So she doesn't forget the pain
I keep my momentum inside my reaction
And hide my pride inside of my laughter
It goes
Got a thing for the women that don't love themselves
So either loosen up your hair or tighten up your belt
And this time, this time is a good time
For good times
And I'll never forget the day you woke up
To find a whole different world underneath your socks
Forgot to check your pockets before you the checked the cost
Yes ma'am, I saw the sign, no ma'am I couldn't stop
Drop off, now look who got water on the lung
Whatever it takes to calm your tongue
If this living room fills with anymore faults
I'm going to cut my finger, I'm going to paint these walls
If anybody watched us
They probably called the cops, cause
It's obvious that neither one of us can adjust
Discussion becomes disgust
If luck was a lady I doubt she would save me from the bum rush
Enough is enough, but how much is too much
Why am I still just a sheep to your touch
Why can't I ever fall asleep at dusk?
Why do I need to see everything crushed?
It's a big map girl, it's yours if you asked
If it don't wash up to the shore you won't discover it
Stand to get hotter then your head with that other shit
Swallow it to chase and follow the suffering
But I'm still smiling, still up to no great
Still trying to relocate
Somewhere I'm going to find some work that matters
Till then all you get is my smirk and my laughter
It goes
Got a thing for the women that don't love themselves
So either loosen up your hair or tighten up your belt
And this time, this time is a good time"

Speak to the youth that keep the truth sacred
Free the, free the good inside your heart

From New York to Cali, some day they'll all know

When I used to look up curse words in my dictionary
If life's a game, gotta choose a side to play
If I gotta pick a position I'ma pick missionary
I've had a little bit too much to think tonight
But it's cool, I be alright, just make sure that I keep travellin

You'd feel the distance even if the bridge was collapsin

Learn em how to take they minutes, turn em into moments
See, nowadays cats think they on some next
And they sacrifice they voice just to go over heads

Why would I work against myself and hide it under my belt?
I used to try to lace the phrases with magic tricks
Every paragraph needed translation attached to it
They saw the style, respected the craft
But all I did was confuse em, would try to get em to laugh
Painted pictures in the primer, no one got the pulp
Found the humor, the anger and the insult
Why should I waste any oxygen
Tryin to find the in-between-the-lines that they get lost within?
I'm out there for the craft, for the cause
The laughter, the applause, the passion for the flaws
The fact that I'ma draw some heads to what I'm feelin

Come on and reach the, reach the masses won by singular
They hold you and they smile when they feel what you can bring to the
Culture and sow it, cultivate the flow with
Breath control and he kept it whole, be-

Catch five rings, then an answering machine
Hang up on the beep, stare up towards the ceiling
Stood up to remember that he slept fully-dressed
So he grabbed his keys and put a hat on his rat's nest
Stepped up to that big outside
Somebody once said ""Today's a good day to die.""
But he never really was a big fan of their work
So he starts up the walk by kicking sand in the dirt
A friend to the strangers, a stranger to friends
He'll take a coffee and a pack of cigarettes when you have a minute
Handle it. Paid up. The change, you can keep it

But only very few mean anything to you
And this house has gotta lotta walls
But only very few mean anything to you

Far from shallow, so get it straight
Blacktop, sidewalk,and the street
'cause life is priceless and talk is cheap
And as he sits (as he sits) in his four-cornered room
Following a tune, born to consume
Carefully learning and analyzing the lyrics you use
Finally realizing that humility is a bruise
Scared love don't make none
If these walls could speak, they would peep about the fake ones
Watching this man, falling off of his plan-
Underachievin' just so he can understand. (Crazy reverse speech.)

So, who did your tattoos?
That's nice
And who built your tabboos?
That's life
If he had a glass pipe, he would smash it and use it to slash his wrists
But someone already beat him to it
He would fingerpaint you a picture with his blood
A self-portrait, dramatic and morbid
But the odds of you finding any appreciation are too slim-
Keeps his outlook grim
Tap his foot to the rhythm of original sin
Throw his balls to the wind trying to know down these pins
He'll keep swinging from the hair above his chin
Till he finds his soul in the fifty cent bin
The price of the payphone escalates
Fake smile when he takes home one of his dates
He could write another hate-poem for you to break
Or maybe stay calm and wait for that big earthquake
Still surrounded by the fire and the water
Still trying to honor this empire's daughter
Still answering questions you're afraid to ask
Still believing that God's gonna save his ass

I woke up on the wrong side of my head
converts the day into search for awake until I go to bed
I drove up, but misplaced the directions they learned
ignored the arrows and the signs
just follow the sense
I don't know whether or not you can comprehend
levers and knobs got stripped and that was just within the launch of it
they found me up in up to my neck
all they saw was his head on top the ocean
it didn't stop the motion,
they kept goin'
perfect, didn't recognize Slug
or the effects he'd have when he disrupts the class
mission bound, twisting around my realm of lost
cash is expensive, I think I can smell the cost
decomposure, something died right behind that wall
TV gave me all I needed
it only took a phone call
paid by the minute
85 percents a second coming
all over the breasts of she who left the water running
flood the basement, drowned the MC's and centipedes
filed complaints, civil suits and try to sue the sidal tendancies
energy drained, drain plugged -- hence the flood

no I don't really know you, but i know who you are
we've spoke a few times, joked a few times
we even toked a few times
I can remember one time purchasing weed from you once
yeah it was worth it
one time we even discussed maybe hooking up and workin'
it didn't happen, but that's not the reason for this
I know I should just get to the point

bottom line is mad or not somebody needs to say this shit
when I'm finished, you might wanna fight
but I don't wanna fight, i've seen you fight
go ahead get wild, and I'll still smile for bein' right
see me and mics are like marriage -- make's life complete
and you've been fuckin' with nasal drugs renders love obsolete
I dare to speak upon you, not to front on you
but I'd rather address this here matter
than have to duck and shun you
it's getting close to harvest, time to count your livestock
all I've got for a hype is a 5 spots to shovel my sidewalk

go tell your kids about my crew and the next venue we're gonna play
stressed out, but that's nothing new everyone is

I'm sparked, waiting for the dark to hit
Cause once the moon gets above my apartment
I catch fits for starting shit
I'm smart with it, I give it that special touch when I push it
Cause I'm also a label rep, and I can't allow no bullshit
So shush kid, shush baby, shut your eyes
Lay your head back, shed the fear and let the tears crystallize
I wish the flies to land upon your forehead
When I extract the essence from your head
and leave your body resting in Moorehead
I've left more dead reputations than HIV can
But for every killing there's a reason and it's not just MC's, man!
I'm watching C-SPAN, waiting for the first state rep
To take the first step, to have me killed off to make this world perfect
Well lets get shit right, right here, right now, right away.
Atmosphere motherfucker, if I need to I could fly away
I'll grind you and your weak crew into beef stew
Serve you with seafood
You can't cloud my vision 'cause you're see-through
[Spawn]
You need to recognize the size of the Atmos
You ain't as tall as half this madness past what you practice
Obviously you can't fuck with my tactics, you bastards
Thats why you breath fast bitch - no need to ask
[Slug]
We dug the fingernails underneath the skin of your scalp, then peeled it
Sent your underdeveloped pre-school style on a field trip
Now bite your tongue, this is how the mic gets done
A whole tree to pick some fruit from, man,
You had to choose the ripest one
[Spawn]
That said it all, it comes from inside, and how you ride
the sound wire when it's live and the vibes feelin right
Catchin' the motion given by rhythms when you hit 'em on time
with lines, makin' sure your rhyme soundin' tight
Your voice should travel without the babble of the average emcee
so listen please use discretion when you breathe
sound is vibration, I choose to use it with a vision
and then comes the style and precision...
[Slug]
No more longer will we hold your hand
Why? Cause you're too damn old
Oh yeah, the networks called
They told me to tell you you've been cancelled
They also said big up for all the support
Thanks to your devotion, they now control the world
So let your hair down and eat the poison with a tall glass of Tang
I'm rising past the bank, with smile I'm flashin my fangs
I tumble over some, 'cause some I don't over stand
I got the clout from Spawn, from now on, I know the plan

It's the noise it makes, that generates the passion I have
It's the void it breaks, that stimulates when mics get grabbed
It takes shape - escapes from these vocal chords I have
Atmosphere: music makers from the Rhymesayers lab

Come now, whofi gwan test the giants, when we apply this
Vice grips to your eyelids to make you read the fine print
The tyrants that gave you crisis, left you silenced
Don't breathe a sigh of relief 'till you hear the rescue sirens

Obviously we hid the key under an upscale rock
So you could knock all you want to but you ain't gettin' in
You could try to crash the door but you ain't gettin' in

ode-to-the-modern-man,2001,atmosphere,Hip-Hop,"This is an ode to the modern man
Its the ode to the modern man
This is the ode to the modern man
Word up this is the modern man
This is that ode to the modern man
This goes out to that modern man
This is the ode to the modern man
Its to the modern man lighting blend
Word to the-e
Im a tad bit to easy on self
And maybe I should keep a closer tab on my health
I suppose that its simpler said than completed
Allow me to attack but in fact again retreated
Completed, this word search crumpled it up and ate it
My hunger for my blue collar heaven keeps me sedated
Escaped it last night in a dream
And now I sleep with a flashlight and it seems
To keep the nightmare demons and semen laced portions parallel
And apart like Stevens Avenue and Portland
A much traveled one way
Or a slow residential
If these camels dont stunt me
Ima grow with my pencil
Once I climb these skulls of this MC graveyard
Ill see the sun again
Ill jump and run again
So come on over visit cause I got a lot to say
And tell Stress I aint mad cause I got my way
But my man Spawn is here now so Im gone make it brief
Finish up my coffee gather up my shit and leave
I got a army of peers we fight singlehanded
And I wont damage your brain till I understand it
You have only one chance to advance to the next stage Im at
Do you really think that you whup ass?
Do I have to ask you?
Did you see what happened to the last dude?
Tried to compare styles word he got his ass chewed
Now with this in mind
Do you still want to bring your shit and find
Out the hard way
Spawns not the one to play
Trade blades with ya might as well slit your own wrists with a razor
Its best cause Im crazier
Blazin ya for my own amusement
In tune with your whole body when I slipt ya whole fixta
This is what happens when your on my shit lista
Brains to give a blista
So next time ya call me sir or mister
Its the words twist a tongue
Used to make the verbs hit ya
Now do you get the fuckin picture?
Well if ya got a same? Ya better call em
Cause my behavior blows kids away like a tall wind
I take yall in between my jaws for consumption
MCs and coffee at my luncheon
One or two lumps and some cream
Call the team for the gathering
Bring mics and turntables lets do our thing
(Ha,) cause its an ode to the modern man
This is that ode to the modern man
(Yeah,) this goes out to that modern man
From Minneapolis St. Paul to that modern man
Its like a dedication to the modern man
This one here this is for that modern man
From Atmosphere going out to that modern man
Its to that modern man, lighting blend
Now for the umpteenth time we kick rhymes about something
Cant front Im frustrated with heads that dont listen
My positions offbalance
Its a constant challenge
Between the talents and the underlying mission
I could fill your heads some more with
Metaphors, some cute catch phrases
Filtered through accessible themes
But if I dont stay sincere to love and hate
How can I differentiate between chasin cream and chasin dreams
Oh yeah, fuck an Mc in my city
That wants to diss me
If I was to bounce to Atlanta with Shocker yall would miss me
So kiss me smack dab on the asshole while you battle
Im with your wife sharin a Newcastle
Big up to Gene Pool
Cause hes the modern man

That kid Abuse that kids a modern man
To Self One yo that kids a modern man
Full Circle you know them kids modern men
The Native Ones word up to that modern man

The door opened, in walked my brother
Terrified, teary-eyed, I'm wide open
Only to hear our father died
It's not true, I'm hopin'
I need some air, I'm chokin
Get me off this ride, where's life goin?
Feelin' I'm lost, I'm frozen
Suspended in mid-traumatized state
Why I'm chosen for this fate? I don't know
Head shakes back and forth emotional
Unsociable, not speakin'
Remainin silent, cause I'm weakened
Deep inside I'm freakin'
Want my father back, I need him
Why's God cheatin?
Takin' half the two that gave me life
My mind replaces thought, now no longer can I sleep at night
Not feelin' right, insecure, now what's my future lookin' like?
Ain't dealt with death before, age 11 and can't take no more
My hands on the floor cause my stomachs feelin' sick and I was mad at the Lord
Because he took him all too quick that day
On his way to pick me up, he never made it
Blamed it all on myself, therefore I dwelled in self-hatred
On a path called destruct, many thought I wouldn't make it
I hate it, the way I feel, but I just can't seem to shake it
Somebody take it away, this mad situation
My world is breakin' and I feel I'm 'bout to cave in
[Chorus x2]
I tried to take it all in
After it all settled I couldn't begin
Accepting you were gone, but understood
[Beyond]
Hey dad, I miss you, for everyday gone
And for the rest of my life, try to remain strong
Until we reunite, live on, your memory
From the seeds you planted gently
Thanks for being there for me
And all the time you spent with me
Love sent for me(?), if I could only have that day back
To sit down and rap, shoot the breeze and have a chat
But the fact still remains, still later, on the day I have to meet our maker
I write my feelings on the paper, for now
Along the golf course where you once played
I see you as I drive by, I feel you like your presence is there
I stop and I stare, I see the pictures of days we shared
Well aware that you cared, makin sure I was prepared for life
The hardships, the struggles, the garbage, and the troubles
That come with it, always kept my head lifted
I grip it close to my heart, everthing you taught me
My dad, my hero, you have my love for all eternity
[Chorus x4]
I tried to take it all in
After it all settled I couldn't begin
Accepting you were gone, but understood"

It's summer, and I'm chillin on my steps with my little crew
Just like the videos, just like all the little rappers do
We voice love to the heads we know that walk past
Sunshine and smilin, Livin out of a shot glass
And I talk fast when it comes to girls
Hey baby I'm just a nut tryin to fuck a squirrel
Maybe we could shut the world up
Let some slug into your life
Suddenly she hypes an eyebrow up, like
""What do you mean?"" and I start buggin like
""If I was to fallowed you home would you keep me
Would you feed me, would you pet me
Would I fuck you till your sleepy?""
She said I'm creepy, and walked off
Too late, I already got off on the fact you even stopped
You knew I'd treat you like an object
You knew I was a rapper, you knew it was the trend
For us rapper men to disrespect women infront of friends
Nonetheless; here comes that kid Sean that I used to be cool with
Went to school with, now this kid is talkin fool shit
Gettin supper touchy with his lips about
how I stuck his bitch supposedly
What the fuck is this supposed to be
Sean's got nuts, hes alone, I'm wit crew
Now tell me what the fuck I'm supposed to do
I spew. Look (???) makes believers of cartoons
And I happen to know your bitch sleeps in until the afternoon
Honestly, my man, you don't bother me
Cause Everybody bleeds, now go and ask your seed who his father be

I'm like ""What, What"" (I'm like) ""What Kid What""

Now Sean kicked my ass, I ain't gonna lie, ain't gonna laugh
It wasnt fun, but fuck 'em, I'ma get my gun
Shit like that gets done in the world of rap
If they pushin on ya vibe, you just a pussy if it slides
So I sprint up three flights, Get into the feet whipe on the door
Draggin dirt and blood on the rug, and the wood floor
Couldn't believe my squad just stood there and watched
Word to God, this boy tellin me to blame it on my cock
I'm amped, and I'ma shoot every motherfucker out there
I'm ill, and I'm gonna prove that shit when I get back downstairs
Into the bedroom, my passion aimed at the closet
Visualizing the top shelf, thats where the shoebox is
I push the top up, enough to fit my hand in
Reach into the box in a frenzy, realizing that it's empty
Hand rests in the box, head festers in an open stun
Then I remember, I don't even own a gun
[Chorus]
""What, What"" (I'm like) ""What Kid What""
I'm like ""What, What"" (I'm like) ""What Kid What""
I'm like ""What, What"" (I'm like) ""What Kid What""

I sever heads just to sharpen my skills
Zoom in on braids like a John Carpenter kills
Surprise, that's the element, your confidence is delicate
Never recuperates, I leave your mutant celibate
Break the victim down to a jelly consistency
The brain twisted spits, now tell me who gets with me
I felt they were listening and the smell of fear amps me
Sweet tooth, room full of candy wrappers, I get antsy
Mission activated, attention captivated
Vocals ring bring the so-called king on stage assassinated
You're nice, where you from?
That's the question I ask
Distraction got struck pull their heart out their ass
The blast is nuclear, when the crew appears
So seek shelter, the only helpful advice
Is that you should steer clear of the exits
I take reps and make messes
Broken, when the spot closes we're off to breakfast
Invested breath, skills, adrenaline
Refill the gut into my hut to build with the pen again

Laid seeds in the soil, preeped to props and honor

To snap you like a bungee when the Sayers takes the country
Hungry and pissed, emptyness makes me grumpy
Take an emcee, stuff him between some bread cheese and lunch meat
It's just a snack, rely on Ant to thrust a track
Into the mind as I slip behind the wack and crush his back
Must react, if we don't we have no worth
So I stomp them, let his team remove remains upon the astroturf
Now who's eager? To be made a believer?
It wakes the dead when I shake a rival's head until his teeth hurt
Knee-jerk, when I yank your brain into a feaver
And melt the weak channels in your receiver
You need to keep your beaver in your pants
Fuck your leisure and your plans
I wear a Van Halen T-shirt
Bust a stance and crush your plans
It's all inside the flows balance, we figure well
Your style has the personality of a speak-and-spell
You need development to reach the plateau I'm at
So take a fat step back so I don't mistake you as a bat

Put down your weapon son
Put down your weapon son
Would you put down your weapon?

I heard a grip of little voices in a thousand heads
Calling me out of my rest to come and plow your steps
An elder once told me to always use precision
(Discretion and vision when you start the ignition)
'Cause any engine is highly delicate and what you got to say
Is irrelevant if you're talking for the hell of it
I smell some shit, check your sole, brotha
did you step in it, now who suffers from my control deficite?
I can't go out like you ('cause you lack dopeness)
I'll break your whole crew down to (a bunch of wack poets)
Shrapnel gets lodged under your clavicle
When your man exploded, Atmosphere concoctin' antidote shit
Fuck 'em and the record deal that they rode in on
When Shawn is in his vocal groove I come to choke your truth
Broke your screws now its open and loose and its ?
(Beyond came along and stabbed a DJ in the foot)
The spokes bend and buckle (and the wheel collapses)
There ain't no need to even ask whether or not you feel the Atmos
I'm peelin' back heads performing brain surgery'
And sewing 'em back up (There, now you've heard of me)

As I sit here with my head between my hands
Attention span focused on trying to read the plans
I can't shake the thoughts that it might be in vain
So I play the radio while I drive me insane
(I travel like the wind) I travel like Avis
I feel as if I've been to hell and back and I ain't even been to Vegas
Pages and pages of notebooks dedicated
To separatin' snake skin and amputatin' fake lips
(Underestimated) But when you heard me, your masculinity went girly
And your whole crew broke out early
(Self-preservated) Avoidance is the first choice
Calculated: Step the fuck away when you hear this voice
Moist, thats how we leave 'em rendered
Either the brain or the pubic region, depending on your gender
And if you're a female head (no disrespect intended)
Unless you step to me on the mic, you must be sheddin' your placenta
I wear the honor of an emcee's past
Where I wonder ""Is this wasteland encased in cheap glass?""
Reflected to find the status where you stand
(You're just another victim with a mic in your hand)

clay,2001,atmosphere,Hip-Hop,"When I first landed the damage was outlandish
anguish, anxiousness, and taking it for granted
but when I first landed I was so relieved I lost my focus
so we exceeded recommended dosages
now I hold the crib? that holds the soul that holds the poet skills
exlcusive it leaves illusions of unfocused flows
I don't suppose you're taking too much time
breaking too much mind trying to unravel the parable?
that dismantled and left the lines in need of some assembly
so I can find the secret key and free all the emcees
this planet spins on a thin axis
all axis passes won't help you to grasp the atmos'
I mean, what did you think
my agenda was to freestyle, smile, get paid to smoke weed,
and grab the mic and spoonfeed?
there's more to this than just paying the rent
if you're riding on this song you need to ride it to the end
[Chorus]
what could you say as the Earth gets further and further away?
planets as small as balls of clay (x4)
some shells get broke
some keep their wigs closed
some get exposed as little man big pose
some make moves and some stay daydreamers
but everbody seems to want some loot, food amd a beemer
well make mine hunter green with camel insides,
10 percent tips, Mr. Pibb and some french fries
inch by inch I take it closer to the shoulder
but day by day it's getting harder to stay sober
once again on the edge, head's inebriated
movement needs motive, it's easier to be sedated
what makes me mighty and another tiny?
why does my psyche give a damn about whether or not you like me?
if this crime's right I might be wrong
I grip this mic tight because it's all I really have a grip on
so let the losers lose and let the players play
the difference is the day to the dust some clay, what
[Chorus - 4X]
who's world is that? it ain't mine, and I'm grateful
already got a plate full of clay on my table
I'm capable of handling fate, I know this
so do the people that get pissed when this microphonist spits
too many get caught up in the lines that emcees thought up
but it's clear to me the ones that fear me are the one's that outta
I spot a blemish on your planet's existence
I deliver subtle terror submerged in clever sentences
instantly pissin? away the misfits
the only residue that came of the hypothecially spew they sprayed
when they swayed I'd have em
half of 'em can't fathom
where the 'Mats? from
I may be on those
you can ask 'em
at last, when we get down to it
there's more than sand and fluid
in how I revolve and evolve
can we solve the secrets? No.
can we take trinkets? No.
so when the ink hits it's more than just a sequenced flow
I can't bring you with me so I'm a leave me here
centuries from now they're gonna study Atmosphere
carefully I steer, I'm aware life is fatal
when I go, I want to go like Ho, taken by the play-dough

I never gave props to emcees who dont deserve it
Never smoked rocks, never had guts to serve it
Never had a glock, never seemed to be worth it
Never had I thought life was gonna be perfect
Never hit the chicks unless I have a jimmy hat
Never leave the crib unless I have my shit intact
Never do I say a rhyme unless the beat is fat
Best believe that, never will the Spawn come wack
Never went to court, never had to serve trial
Never went to jail, had no records on file
Never direspect, never treat my friends wild
Cus I never had real friends till now

complications,2001,atmosphere,Hip-Hop,"Spoken: Yo this is dedicated, to this girl that I dated
Complicated maze, Complicated maze
[Verse 1]
At first sighting, only a stranger to my eyes, couldn't keep them off me
I'm sure your friend recognized, I didn't care, I had to stare, stood there at attention
Not many words mentioned still I felt the thought connection, wanted to sex then
Got to know you wanted more, Things got complex when
You had a man and wasn't sure
My thoughts were pure, Is it gonna be him? Or is gonna be me?
Cause that's the way I have to have it
Grasped the idea, Ms scribble head Talia
Wanted you to feature but your man is screwing up the procedure
What is it that you say? I'm on your mind all day
But still say you're content, how the situation lay
Why you play? Why do you stay? There's something better
Know you felt it when you received my first poetic letter
Why you fronting? Tell me something
Is it that you want your cake and stuff it down your face too?
Did I have to chase you?
Why oh why do you cry?
Instead of afraid of losing me I think that you're confusing me a lot
No wait a minute stop, bring that back I missed a page
Was it that time of the month or were you going through a phase?
[Chorus - repeat 2X]
Complicated maze. This phrase fits you perfect
Come back in later days. Talk to me when you're certain
You're always changing. Never stay the same person
Come back in later days. Talk to me when you're certain
[Verse 2]
Miss Merry weather, the partial, the martial artist of fake imitation love products
Now facing you is irritation
Know you used to have me placing you on pedestals like a goddess
Personality changes it seemed to me you were the oddest
Soon to depart us like red seas by Moses
Our friendship's diseased, unfeasible, hopeless
No reasonable answers to my question of focus, Caused my tension
Nothing made sense when you replied with a tied tongue
Said you feared abusiveness, I never swung
Why all these excuses miss? What have I done?
Figured I had the right kind of lady, yeah maybe it was fun, for you
But not for me, I found it quite unamusing
You were using me as a bridge just to pass what was left behind
Play times for dangerous minds, but why'd it have to be mine?
Why'd it have to be mine?
[Slug - speaking]
Now I'm not really trying to come of abrasive
but why you messing with my mans head?
I mean I'm spending time trying to keep his mind on rhymes and beats
and you're a distraction. I mean you got my man just shook
I mean honestly I guess what I'm trying to say is...
[Chorus]
Virgin torn from sleep, the newborn
(*Slug speaking* 'Why are you doing this? See you're too old to be playing games')
And it was easy to get too deep, the water was lukewarm
Virgin torn from sleep, the newborn
(*Slug speaking* 'you wanna come back?')
And it was easy to get too deep, the water was lukewarm
[Verse 3]
Do you know what today is?
It's the third anniversary, you came back to flirt with me
For certain, you must mistake me for a fool
See I know how you are, I see those tricks in you
Tried to make amends, there's something new
Had problems with your friend, so it's me you always run to
Come to, and smell the coffee, go drink the pot with extra caffeine
Cause next to acting you win awards for cloudy vision
Tired of vision for the what, why and when
Will this repetition end, step away and give me oxygen
Not interested in talking, say nothing keep walking go bout your away
See the colors of these areas have started turning gray
See you later goodnight, got no more candles to light
Yo its time to move along cause baby something isn't right
Still I'm glad I met you, its too bad you screwed it up
The only thing I regret is that I didn't get to (fuck)

Hence forth, step within my psychoanalysis
callouses upon my mind make me strain for my lines
out I ripped it, squeezed the brain, it made some liquid
drained it in a cup and then I sipped it
Atmosphere! The mic let me clutch it
thoughts take flight so fit the Slug in your pipe and take a puff kid
fuck it! I heat it like a tea pot - steam hot
upon the roof, shoot a marble with the verbal slingshot
take aim, here I came, I'm the same
Back in '86, I'da tag my name upon your window pane
stained the mind: a deep shade of residue
voices within the head make choices multiple
multiply Spawn, Slug a little buzz
and Atmosphere the scuds, 'cause here come the judge
blasted; so pass the kid a mic so we can paint this
image of the gifted-anxious, to flip the language
it's the noun meltdown from the outer-shell
now smell the burning flesh fresh from the hell-bound
and come on down here, this mind path, I'm half-
mathematic Atmospheric staff with the rhyme craft
comin to capture, your after-laughter
while I'm hangin from this rafter, I have to rip this rapture
'cause the cramps in my stomach, dismantle
when I tamper with your amplifier, damn you die...
Why try?
The sky presents an eternally unfolding spectacle:
One moment puffs of cumulous clouds scatter across it
and next a billowing thunderhead
perhaps 10 miles high looms over the horizon
probing the structure of the sky...
Why try?
Cause I can read an emcee from front to back
from the cover to the classified - I've pacified
my mind with my rhyme skills - I climb hills
and leap, foolish twitch with a single bound
sending tingles down your spine, designed to swing a pound
this ax-handle triple-inch-spike protruding
from the tip of my mic distrubuting fuckin headshots
shots to your head, now you're knee-deep, you need sleep
as you trutch thru the sludge and the slugs and the bird shit
we swarm with the bees and diseases
and even if your dj was Jesus, you could never fuck with these kids
I've swarmed with the bees and diseases
and even if your dj was Jesus, you could never fuck with these kids
[Spawn]
Yea muthafucka! you know who you fuckin with
you know what kind of ass whooping comes with this
your whole crew could get some of this,
your wack ass fuck kids is what the subject is
roughnecks live, for only a second
then they give
oblivion's, what you've stepped in
your reps tooken, should have been lookin
I'm sick of you bitch-ass crews when:
you tried take what's not your but 'cha couldn't
take mine, your fake rhymes - spit them you shouldn't
what will it be now? another victory
yo who will it be now? it's Spawn that emcee
complete, a true champ - stamp that on my essence
amped shootin presence, fattenin each fuckin sentence
when its time, then it's time to go
that's what I know, be rippin mics at every show we flow
but who's got my back though?

[Slug]
Bam, the door way opened for me
I saw ways and told the story
Raw day dreams of holding glory
Junior high,
Hall way king
Lockin' faggot MCs
Beat boxin', breakin' Zulu Nation wannabees
It didn't take long to see who would stay strong
High school upon
Some B-Boys put their gang bangs on
But some kept on doing
Step on to ruin
Others that were pursuing the same shit we thought we ruled in
But what a surprise
The passion for being the best
Puts a quest for allies to rest
Dead
In the Midwest where heads
Is just a hand full
In a land of gangstas
Players, replacements, priests, banjos
We scramble
To break MCs that may appreciate it
Guided by their envy insecurity and their hatred
Separated by the gimmie props technique
And a desire to be the tops this week
I gotta floss the speak
Cause talk is cheap
Even the broke kids can afford it
That's why I stand close and if you're dope then I'm supportive
But if not
We'll keep the mic warm
For the next one
Respect the artform
And make your wishes on the stars born
Within the movement
Fact checkin' tryin' to completely avoid all channels of backstepping
From the lines of paint on the concrete
They reside on Lake Street
To the way we close our eyes to sleep
And drift through Deep Space 9 type shit
To find this
I've been around for as long as sound
I've been to that not so fresh faze
And that not so serious state but I've evolved
Metamorphed manifestate
I used to be young, dumb and full of vision
Like it was religious rituals
I made initial decisions
I wanted to be a rapper world renown
From Minneap to the Bronx
Capture girls in crowns
Snap, crackle and stomp
That's what I found
The abyss that sits in-between the one that holds the mic and those that
don't even listen
Formed some crews
Rocked talent shows at schools
Saturdays on the 18 make my way down to the record pool
I met a grip of people that was bullshit
Was down with a lot of people that was bullshit
But I pull shit from the asshole of an angel before I let him hassle and
strangle
The love triangle between me the mic and the turntable
Went to studios
We want to make demos
We want to do shows and rock our own instrumentals
Do our own production
Fuckin' around with this kid Kazir
Nitwit engineer
Barely knew his own equipment, Atmosphere
The prefix was urban
Wrecked shows
Made friends made foes
Overall we made flows
And right now as I sit here writing this
I'm buggin' off the people in my life that made me like this
Within the movement
Fact checkin'
Tryin' to completely avoid all channels of backsteppin'
From the lines of painted concrete
that reside on Franklin Ave
To the dead bird on the elevator
To that short in your cross fader
I never got lost later
For efforts to pester
Just throw your hands up in the air like a leper
I've been to that not so fresh faze
And to that not quite so serious state
Metamorph manifestate
Well sometimes it rings and I don't answer it
That's it no asterisks
No thirst to find the circumstances
It was planted in me deep
It was nurtured and it grew
Gave it sleep and nutrition
It was efficient let it through
There are a few that have developed when I let them in my spectrum
For the rest of em
I give them just enough to cause infection
Not trippin' on attention
But if you ? it's welcome
Open arms patient charms
I know the words and I can spell them
Seldom is it
When one inquisits
Do they leave with this interest
In fact most begin crave the business
Bringin' me to the table
That's it no more no less
The love the life the stress
Slug, the mic, the mess
Testin'
Yes, I've been tested and I've tested some
I'm not sayin' I'm the best
Believe I'm not
Like the rest of em
Just sayin' I'm better than you
That's my mind state
My rhymes take me into
When I check one two
I guess some do get pissed
But intentions were to inspire
Built the empire before I get tired
The ones that tare me down don't know it
But they're the same ones that build me
Now quietly in your head say, ""Yes you can feel me.""
[Sample: ""Asking himself, even before the curtain goes up, what am I?
I am now 80 years old, and more, and I am determined to find precisely
what I am, what I amount to. They tell me I am everything, they flatter
me everyday, of my life. I am now going to subject myself to a rigorous
test in order to find out really what I am. I don't care about KINGDOM? I don't
about rule, anymore. It is of no importance to me, as such, but I must
find out what I am before I die.""]"

You tell a slut you love her and miss her hug her and kiss her
I fuck her and diss her probably was your cousin or sister

There go Jim there go Killa but where's Hell Rell
There go Freaky Santana but where's Hell Rell
I'm here now everybody thanks for all the fan mail
But fuck a bitch I don't love them either (Naw)

Robbed for every dollar that they got in their safe
See I'm something like a phe-no-me-non (Yea)

I amaze 'em like dag, you ain't a killa please
That ain't no killa weed, them twigs are filled wit' seeds
I hit the Philippines across the river seas
O.C. for weeks where I don't feel the breeze
So I got heifers, whores, with some excellent jaw
Like the vet for sure, who want me to sex them raw
But I X'd them all, get some head in the bed
Then walk the chickenhead right towards the exit door
Just face it my nig', you can't stay with the kid
I got paper, gators, many flavors ya dig
They just hate how I live, 'cuz the only time they see me

You wait till shit comes, i get it and go
Different strokes, for different folks, shit I ain't tryin'
To come up short, let on, let it all
Or will i just blow, addicted to coke
Not me, some of us hood rich, but now you dissin', the rich niggaz is broke
The government, shit they make us sniff' coke
Instead of embracin' us, fuck savin' us, they gives us the ropes
A million guns in the hood, what the fuck you think
How can one another cope-- get ya stoned and then some weed
Just go, eight children broke, the statistics, every three hours
A brother is smoked, a baby is killed, a sister is raped
Somebody mother, strangled under that dope
Just get up and say, here, get up and pray
Tomorrow and promise, so I live for the day, just for hip hop
I need all, but tell ya rappers to come back, yea
We work too hard, to give us away, evicted my age
I can't grow up, like Eazy-E, a victim of AIDS
Being black is crime, I done worked, a nine to five
For three years, and they still, ain't give me a raise
Shit give me a gauge, fuck a mininum wage
Get in a helicopter, look down, shit we live in a maze
The day go fast, when ya broke, but it seems like
The minute you pay, the sun, never set
I don't sleep, 'cause sleep is the cousin of death
So I wake up, my brother, my cousins, and uncle's that's def, yes

Be brave, in the Wizard of Oz, they build you a heart, get some courage
to get the light, most flow in the dark, won't get discouraged
I'm on the one way trip to heaven, forget the luggage
chest in pain, it's making me weak, it's making me sluggish
Besides me, hogging up my THC

I count on my fingers, how many niggaz got a GED
My life done work more, than TV, and the DVD
Fuck a CD, I wanna be free, money for me
I'm like a cat, caught in the tree, ok, I need help
Why do I do for others, when I know, when i kno i should do for myself
You be there when you need me, they collapse
Under the real woods, in me, if I need, another match
I chuckled, pool game, goodie mob, goodie help
Coke kid, frankly, GNC, respect yes
My brother Kenny, I will pay you back, for every penny
I got the many mentions, it's yours, nigga the key to the drawers
So I work out, try to keep my endurance

Supply you with crack that'll get your fiends back

My gun hold twelve shells, like a carton of eggs

But I ain't talk about money, when it cost you an arm and a leg
Sparking up haze in the Garcia Veg', have you cleaning my house
That's the one way ya squad'll be me
Sparkin' the gaze, like barbers that fade
I turn ya head to the Red Sea, and I put a part in ya waves
I'm why niggaz smoke a carton a day, I blow ya father way
Just to make you go, farther away
'cause in my hood, you try to floss fresher than Manny
You be sweet Vicks like the cough medicine candy

Let's do it, man, nuffin', man
Yo, yo, these stories I spit, I seen 'em, I wrote 'em
Like the teen, he was boastin', 'La Vida Loc'in'
In his dream I awoke him, the beamer, I drove it
It was the beam that I showed him, that I keep by my scrotum
I seen him, I sowed him, I leaned him, I told him
The demons arose an' bullets, pull it
A hour just to clean 'em an' load em, doggy
You had a slow summer, I didn't, H.2 gold Hummer
Not to mention new Range, no number
An' you know the Rover, so move over, soldier
Flavor Coca Cola, garage, the soda holder
An' it's over, over, here's a clover dojer
I'm that nigga now, everyone that knows ya, told ya
Byrd Gang, but we live by the codes of Cobras
Hoopties, drive by's, long nose through Nova's
If you dope, I dope ya, where the pimps are colder
The end is over, Coroner, come roll him over
An' I don't just look real, this crook deals coke
Only thing whiter, dog, is Brook Shields
Harlem, holla back, how the hood feel?
Platinum, I'm that real, you that shook deal
Took deals out the building, up the block
Up 29 flights, plugged up with the Roc
Now it's hurtin' ya heart to see dame fuckin' wit me

Sell my nigga weed, it's hilarious
They squeeze at the cabbages, seeds in the carriages
Thieves, Bronx, Queens, an' the Razamith
Milk an' Ock Mu will come steamin' the Ratchet, bitch
Transactions, lobby get done
Bein' cocky is fun an' these are Versace, Air Ones
Yea, thanks a lot, it been great, dame
My bitch is a great dame, my dog is a Great Dane
You know me, I'm from the 24 an' A. train

Unload the click clack, to ya fit cap
Hold the shit back, say goodbye and go commit that
For 9 years the Spain had to time share
Back to time square, I got dimes here
By the port authority but I got more authority
Your girl she order Maury, check she forge it for me
Reporters report me, how she report to the orgy
But it's more to the story, her daughter applaud me

I'll touch slap her, dap her, plus clap her
Tell her drink cum, get drunk, it's nut cracker

Clockwise, counter-clockwise, it's all in the wrist shorty
Fuck with me
This is a movement, this is a union
This is more then what you people call music
I'm part of this Dip Set confusing
Tecs we moving, catch up, y'all losing
Y'all ain't big enough to be at the table, nope
Y'all ain't big enough to eat at the table, nope
This is powerful music that I bring to the table
The sequel of Able, fuck with your boy
You motherfuckers really don't know
You motherfuckers really wont know
I'm real fucka, I really wont fold
I kill fuckas and wheelie off roads
Bangie rapper, like I'm really off road
The pain I feel, I really wont show man
The game is real, I really don't know Cam
If I'ma make it or not
But my plan was to take it straight to the top
Bring my fame to the block, with me
Harlem's my home, so I'm making it hot with me
Till the day I'm laid on the block, with shots in me
Stay weeded, stay cheffing a blunt
Stay losing some more pounds, I ain't eating enough, nope
Stop fronting homes, you wont do nothing homes
Killa locked this, I'm what's up and coming homes
You better believe, one thing I was always taught
In my household you better achieve
No matter what you do, you better succeed
That was embedded in me, yeah, the rest was left up to me
So I, played my position, I stayed in the kitchen
Base tripping on the bottom of the plate when I'm mixing
Cake whipping on the bottom of the plate when I left it
Eight digits when I take it, break it and flip it
This is the Matrix, I take it we live in
Shit, I'm seeing the sun, I'm Neo the one, believe me
Hand picked like cotton, I've been sent here not to be forgotten
My hands grip the dots in, I get ya poppin'
Shoot shit, shit is poppin'
Move bricks get it rocking, y'all know me
Ya young homie from the block, y'all forgot me already?
Holla back, the young Rocky is ready whoa!
This is a movement, this is a union
This is more then what you people call music
I'm part of this Dip Set confusing
Tecs we moving, catch up, y'all losing
Y'all ain't big enough to be at the table, nope
Y'all ain't big enough to eat at the table, nope

It's Santana the rap +He-man+
Why yall skeltors get your melons torched when this weapon sart letting off
Santana no, don't hurt 'em, don't squirt 'em
Don't let the nine burn 'em in the sternum
They don't want to go to war with ya'
They ain't ready to bang or go to war with ya'
So leave 'em alone, don't feed 'em the chrome

Smooth thug, will Pretty Tony your wifey

Why yall can't fuck with the ""Great"" Santana, bandanna give in clips and weight
Hammers will split your face, shift your waist, to a different place
Next thing you know, I'm in a different state
Back next month, new whip, different plate
Damn, Santana delivery the raw
Delivery the four, for sure man, I did it before
So if your bitch is a whore, don't fight for her
Don't waste your life for her, trying to make it right for her
With all that frontin' your doin', and stuntin' you're doin'
I'll shoot the bump while you moving and shut you from moving

Why yall niggas don't ride like I do
Slide through in that 7-4-5 blue, right beside who? Killer
Where Jones, in the pick-up truck
Yeah we use that to pick up stuff, pick up bucks
And my Denali is often parked, inside of my condo
How much did he sign for?
Oh, I bet you want to know that money
Yeah I bet you I won't show that money
I keep it stashed away, right next to the 4-4, money
Keep a lo-pro money, this is slo-mo money
I'm used to that fast crack, bag crack
Re-cook bag that, give it out, half that
If it still bags, have stacks
No more running back to me, coming back to me

I'm what the people call a menace to the public society
Fuck 'em I'm riding, my gun on the side of me
Fuck it I'm driving, I'm puffing high as can be
I'm speeding, I'm weaving, I'm bugging my eye on the street
Cam signed to the Roc it's time that we eat
Harlem's back, this time it's for keeps
You rolling or not?
The Takeover's now, y'all focused or not?
We been ready it's just that our promotion was not
But I can't blame no one for this, I'm all right with that
Can't be racist cause I sell too much white for that
So I decided I'mma milk these crackers for all they milk and crackers
Until I'm rich and these mills don't matter
Uh, you niggaz follow my plot?
If not, swallow these shots, Santana swallow your block
I run with enforcers, big dudes and bosses
Black, British and Walter, the phone call will cost ya'
Keep rolling in them caravans acting
We got big trucks with chrome Taliban action
Send one up to Jabar, my nigga maxed in
T-Money's home and he's never going back in

Aiyo, I swear to God, you think I had a violin the way I fiddle triggers
How you older than me, and still a little nigga

Get their check, hair, nails done, steak and chicken, for they friends

Word to Jehova man, hoes in they shoes, barking like a Doberman
Coming to see Cam, for some coke again

Shit, it's the first of the month
Yo, I'm the first on the block for the cycle
A rock that is first like shoots from a rifle
See they tainted our image, it's fucked up how the game painted our image
They say we dangerous people, why, because we sell caine to the people
That don't be the reason I be aiming this eagle, my aims to get equal

And leave you dead pop shot from them glammers
And go down south and rock wit them bamas
And come back in the Porsche color hot banana
Vanilla coat seats piper made by Tropicana

Watch my pockets increase ta knots

Walk the beat in my bop an my beef and brocs
Ice in my piece an watch
Ain't too many niggas that can reach the top
Or speak this hot
Peep this pop I leave you not
I rhyme over beats wit the meanest drops
And teens'll flock
Seen my spot an seen my props
Red when you seen the cops
Got your wife suckin' semen cock
I'ma Taliban lyrical monster
They'll shout the city I conquer
White Ice cinnamon Parker

Hundred thou just ta glitter the charm up

Hitting curves like Emitt Smith

And to my soldiers rocking green in the country
Keep your dean and stay hungry, let get this cream and get money

It's Santana, Heatmakers, where we at?

Killa, Jones, Freakay
Yeah man, I'm back at it
Today's a new day, got the boo-lay up in the suitcase
Go uptown to Harlem, tell 'em that I sent ya
Tell 'em it's August, I'm ""Gon' Til' November""
I need a couple birds, get a broad, have 'em sent up
Call my bird, get my broad have her sent up (Please)
Call my niggaz, call my squad, have 'em sent up (Please)
I see a town I'm likin'
See some niggas getting money in a town I like it
I run up on them with the pound and light it
Like it's my block now, all right kid?
He understood me quite clear
Then that thing banged out, ranged out the side of his right ear
And I got back to my business, back to my bitches
Back to the kitchen, that pyrex vision
Pop, I let that white stuff sit in
Get hard, get rock, get to the block and pitchin'
Yeah I'm sorry but this is how I'm livin
And this is how I'm getting, fuck how I get it
Hey!
[Chorus: Juelz Santana]
I stood alone watching the wall, in the zone, hand on my handles
Listening to gangsta music
I stood at home hand on a chrome, with a zone, flippin' the channels
Watching how the gangstas do it
I stood alone, getting dome, from a thick chick in sandles
Watching Shaft, clocking math
[Juelz Santana]
Now I see death around the corner
Gotta stay high, will I survive in the city where the skinny niggas die?
Nope, it's the city where the skinny niggas ride
.45 semi on the side, twisting when they drive, yeah
Lick a shot for Big Pop and 'Pac, yeah
One more for Shyne locked inside, yeah
Two more for Cam, for taking over the Roc
Yeah, yeah, it's my year
So, okay, okay, okay, y'all can't fuck with me, no way
Jose or Hector Camacho
Tech blows and watch yo' chest close and tacos
Motherfucker I'm the best, I told y'all before

Where we flash money, take your bitch and ask you, what now?
Birds flip a dozen, chicks is dicks they suckin'
Swallow my kids, go and kiss they cousin
Yes, they kissing cousins, toys kissing muppets
Worst then that, they go home and kiss they husband
That shit's disgusting
Keep the chickens clucking, keep the pigeons buggin'

My homey Cash, well he gone for five
Send my prayers, do your thing, I'll be going for mine
Shit, we live life to the fullest
Three hundred and sixty five nights on the strike, that's a bullet
Shit, and uncle Ricky got a month and some change
And it feels like the garbage truck just dumping the pain
All on my shoulders, I'm warning my soldiers
The nights could get chilly, but the morning's much colder
I've seen summers get cold
And niggaz do it up until the point they done and the fold
They can't succumb to the cold
Those of frostbitten, up north sitting, just like some fucking lost kittens
They get locked up for carrying boy
Doing time underground up in Marion, boy
Shit, I respect you
You do your time like Gotti, and come home like that Marion boy
[Chorus: Cam'Ron + Jim Jones - repeat 2X]
You got weed? Smoke it, You got dice? Roll it
You got guns? Shoot it, You got a ho? Stroke it
You got money? Spend it, You got cars? Whip 'em
You caught a bid? Do it, You got kids? Love 'em, hug 'em

I gotta keep striving, I gotta keep moving, I gotta keep grinding
If this was the road, and I was a trucker, then shit man, I gotta keep driving
Through the lies and deception, had to ride through neglection
I'm an insomniac, up all night, pops and moms was an addict, shit
My puffing scums is a habit
I need me a contingency plan, my pops with the syringe in his hand
He was leaning and nodding
Uncle Ricky your mission is like Afeni was Robin
Shit, you should've seen the apartment
All I ever wanted was franks and beans I was starving
Crack fiends on the carpet, shit
But if it wasn't for grandma
I swear I'm in love with my grandma
That's why I only does it for grandma
That's when I roll in the street
I pray she covers me from the crown of my head, to the sole of my feet
[Chorus]

I figured its means as a minor, huh
Look at the foods ad fibers
The dude with the cubes will snipe ya
More tools then snider
Exclusive writer
The jewels are fire
I learned don't fool with rider from pop
I don't need a gun, just a screwdriver
Two tires, two pliers, a wrench and a few wires, shit
I take it all from the buyers
Bonfire, all from a lighter, call me ""Macgyver""
Need a rehab I'll call up Shania
Bitch hungry, good, we gonna stall in papaya
Take your recession special, yeah you less then special
Me and Jim Jones, extra special
Check it, Dre to Snoop, Gotti to Ja
Dame to Jigga, Puff to Big, D n' why
Doggy you next up, get your respect up
Or a vest can't protect you when I hit you in your chest, duck
The big heads done pushed me
You gotta be sex: dickheads is pussy, killa
I bring the hammers to the gunfight
One night stand, only standing for one night
Doggy, cause when it come to that cash
No homo, I will jump in that ass, jump and I flash
Then jump in that jag, jumpsuit
Jump back from the coroner, I have you jump in that bag
Come with that cash

Aiyyo, I argue with my mother
Spring, summer, fall and winter time
Get that off the table Cam'ron it's dinner time (What?)
I got a line downstairs ma, I'm in the grind
From ten to nine, you do your business right
Let me attend to mine
You cooking pork anyway, I ain't into to swine (At all)
You out ya mind, nah
You don't know what's in my mind
I'ma surpass crack, move on to Nasdaq
But still my connects move anthrax on Amtrak
Aiyyo, Cam before the cops rush, close the spot
Load the glocks they stuntin', we control the block
They frontin' we throw them shots and laugh at 'em
Shoots from the 4-4 magnum, that's how we get back at 'em
Trap 'em, grab 'em and clap at 'em
Yeah, I do this for my lost tribes and Africans
Who lost lives in battling, 4-5s and hacklin'
I believe in black soldiers, black covers
Black roses on your grave
Snakes and black cobras
Black vultures, rats, roaches
Sleep now, they laughs over, fucka'
You can catch real niggas
Doing some real things, for real money
'Cause real niggas get money, real niggas don't snitch
Real niggas don't lie for a bitch, real niggas get rich

I throw away 20s on boots and stuntin'
Waste 50s and abuse my hundreds
I'm getting money, yep, I spend thousands
On the shoes for the coup it's nothing
Plus big truckin' too it's nothing
I lick a shot so he know I meant it
His soldiers dented, so is his rented
Supreme soloist and still co-defendant
And you notice, a mean motorist that blows the fifth on defendants
Since roota-rooda, yes the Motorola yes sir I'm splendid
You see the furs and pendants, Austin Sigoto, drop though
Hitting curves like Emitt Smith
(From Europe)
If you ain't get it, the fifth will hit your fitted
Clips I get it spitted, flip your wig I really lift it
I'm this burgundy Benz, swervin' be
As I'm watching the snow fall
I'm watching the heads they copping the coke y'all
And to the fiends and junkies, the broken dreams of drunkies
Hoes with low esteem, you know they scream on their monthly
(Shut up bitch)
And to my soldiers rocking green in the country
Keep your dean and stay hungry, let get this cream and get money
Them haters wishing they could see my demise
Break my moms heart, the grief in her eyes
Man that eats me alive, let's roll this weed and get high
This what keep me alive (Listen to me)
My Dip Gang man, they the peeps that'll ride
Over me the same peeps that have died

Up and now murder, it's foul murder
Turkeys to cowburgers the code to I'll murder
Child if you style or wild splurge
Stay away OK, Mr Giles'll hurt you
I ain't go to school, stayed the hell at home
In the real estate dog I seen hell at homes
You was selling out I was selling homes
Selling dreams to the phone, I can sell the tone
In the science lab I mix me chemicals
In silicone fella in the vanilla cone
The school even play the recorder
Now days he work for F-E-D-S
And plays his recorder
You think he placing he taping his order
Marking the bills they read,
Tasting the waterf***ed up
We duct-taping his daughter
That's the taping they taught us
In addition add the eight and the quarters get it
In addition Ma, yeah you get it dog
Gets it and ditch it
Kitchen whipping and flip it raw
Get it all off the kitchen floor
My bad is my bad, the baddest ask me
What I'm b****ing for
What I'm b****ing for?
Is to put the is in all
Furs his or hers b**** go pitch it whore
No disrespect Mami, no disrespect at all
In a year or two maybe you can get a store
You should honor my core
You want a Honda Accord

That's a real friend
That's a homie right right true
I fell that is only right
That I live the life of rally
I done did knives in alleys, pipes, in rallies
What you do now?
Now I catch flights to Cali
Looking for a wife to spouse I pipe her proudly
She understands my life gets rowdy
I'm the same say
Prane day I'm icy outey
Yo, now I done been on both sides of the fence
Now I done been on both sides of the gate
Survived and escaped
Look at me now man I'm driving away
Thinking about my old teacher who said I rot and decay
(Never)
I go back and beep the horn at them
Blowing that cheech and chong at them
Yelling, screaming the boy is platinum
It all happens so fast
They all imagine I crash
But I did straight through I'm bad
Like Michael was see what the cycle does
360 spin around, I'm the new kid in town
Yeah it's coming soldier,
April the month it's over
Yeah your run is over
The album is done I told you
What a classic I made, I look up see Cam
See the game what a path that he made
A beautiful mind trapped in the shade
Cracking codes for the man
Who only stand in the back of my brain
At last I done came up in the proper way
True author like the great doctor J was
You can't respect the amount jewels in this new wide movement
If you don't respect the amount of dudes in this too live movement
Me and Killa, we like them,
Those two guys moving I-95 south dirty
With them two pies moving, moving
Trying to crease out the lightning
Trying to keep out the excitement
But it's hard in this bulls***, in this game
'Cause the secret indictments
And you coke experimenters
And you coke experiencers
Be easy on the phone dog,
'Cause you know the hearing us
You styling them b****es
Cause you know they serious
Just picturing, it's so easy to draw
Stop and freeze at them whores
Then we speed off in cars
Then we breezing the law
Blowing that weed from my jaw
G's up hoe's down
East Side to by dog
(East Side)
All the time man
Thanks for even asking
Or we be seen in Aspen
In that pool house, that hot tub with that steam relaxing
And we be seen in action
Keep them fiends collapsing
And they thirsty and they nodding and the be ?
They see me my actions
I cruise by in a Beemer just laughing
I let that rock and roll
I coping poppy's load
It was like coping gold,
I shut down poppy's load
I hit the strip dog
I see the cops get load
Now I'm living the life I got to stop and close

I like that, yeah who are you? Santana
Shit is crazy man
Why'all think niggaz don't cry? We do
Yeah, man I gotta get my thoughts together, I be thinking a lot
Light up a blunt, think of a rhyme sometimes too
But it's like yo...zone out
The time is now, my grind is here shit
My body is focused, my mind's in gear, let's start it
I'm moving at an unstoppable pace, I managed to reach the top of the race
Before it started damn, cold-hearted man
Rip apart your man, for that green dollar
Plain reppin' my target, stay and holla
Shoot and move from where ever my targets land
Damn, shit, I see ghosts when I sleep
It's really, I got to wake up, just to know I was sleep
Holding the heat, cold sweat all over my sheet
That's why I paint the most vividest pictures
My niggaz my bitches in the same position I live in
No oil and hot water, just boiling hot water
Cooking coke, to the oil and hot water, shit
But who am I
I lived the life of a loner, with a righteous persona
But still sold crack right on the corner
My life consist of, a big puzzle that's mixed up
Big bucks, big drugs, if I get caught, then it's big cuffs
Big bailor gets up, I get out, shit what, this shit sucks
I need to find another road to follow
One that's new and strong, not old and hollow
As I hold this bottle and smoke this reefeer
Listening to some old Aaliyah, I say, damn...
And a tear comes trimbling down
Never seen a man cry, well you witness it now
Shit, this isn't game from the heart, this pain from the heart
This is for you Dame, it came from the heart, so
Momma, I just want you to know
I'm in love with you so, if you wasn't here I'd be in love with you soul
My angel, mommy I'd die faithful
Just knowing someone tried to violate you
I'll slide eighths through the side of their facial
Squeeze and rip apart a side of their facial
I'd take a slug, eat a bullet, swallow a gun
Shit, you gotta know I'm your son
Damn, this type of love, could only come from a son
Hold up mommy, I'm twisted I'm drunk...listen"
i-love-you,2003,diplomats,Hip-Hop,"[Juelz Santana]
People say my theories is backwards
I tell them, sincerly, it's clearly, you hearing me backwrds
I tell 'em I'm great, but still I need practice
I tell them to wait, go and comeback quick, they don't understand me
It's not logic, I'm not logic, I got problems
I worship the late prophet, the great Muhammad Ali
For the words that he spoke, that stung like a bee
Soaked into me, you niggaz will see but
I'm still insane, I'm Rodman, dealing my brain
I'm grinding sharing my pain, fuck, where is the fame
Niggaz, they still rhyming, still in the game
They still dealing the cane, still cock shit in your brain, homie
I still smell the rotten people that lay
There in ground zero, forgotten, left in for days
Probably left there to stay, left in decay
Broken pieces of towers, left in their graves
I pray they be saved, until then, that's just a suggestion I made
Follow me homie, listen, I subjected my ways nigga
Weapons that spray, at your fucking face nigga
It's Santana the great, in the place niggaz, stay away nigga
Cause I'm headed straight to the top, niggaz
Diplomat Taliban slash ROC nigga
Oh yeah, I do this for my block niggaz
D train, Al Gator, pop niggaz
Young drugs, young twins, Shiest bug
Niggaz I love, my thugs
Now, come fuck with your boy
Jones, Killa, Freakay, come fuck with your boy, WHOA
It's Santana again nigga, no bandanas just him nigga
In the flesh, like
[Cam'Ron]
I seen it time, business and friendship
Friendships ended, business attended, clips get extended
Lawyers get called, accountants get faxed
That was my man, well I wish that he meant it
It's been a long time, hereing the mobsters
This ain't overnight, it's years in the process
Shed a tear in the process, now process is over
All my niggaz get prepared for the Oscars
Back to the block, sharing a lobster
Morris Malone, Sam Malone, preparing the vodka, holla
Hallejulah, no hum-do-allah, but respecting my Aki
He held me down, when it was getting real rocky
Hustling, isn't a hobby
I sit in the lobby, look at my ovie, have visions of Gotti
Visions of lotties, pictures of Blood, scenes of L
I want to see my son, piss in that potty
Jimmy, I'm going to make sure your wrist is real rocky
See my plans are for long term like Mr. Miyagi
Wax on, wax off, put our wax on, take that wack off
Over some nights, I had fights over the white
The roads to the lows, I knows what it's like
Now, career over like Mike: anyone
Tyson, Jordan, Jackson, it's over
This shit right here touched my soul, man
My grandmother or something, 56 bless her soul

Cocked back used to crash your homies, oh
Why yall can't fuck with me man, I guarantee man
It's Santana the rap +He-man+
Why yall skeltors get your melons torched when this weapon sart letting off
Santana no, don't hurt 'em, don't squirt 'em
Don't let the nine burn 'em in the sternum
They don't want to go to war with ya'
They ain't ready to bang or go to war with ya'
So leave 'em alone, don't feed 'em the chrome

Why yall can't fuck with the ""Great"" Santana, bandanna give in clips and weight
Hammers will split your face, shift your waist, to a different place
Next thing you know, I'm in a different state
Back next month, new whip, different plate
Damn, Santana delivery the raw
Delivery the four, for sure man, I did it before
So if your bitch is a whore, don't fight for her
Don't waste your life for her, trying to make it right for her
With all that frontin' your doin', and stuntin' you're doin'
I'll shoot the bump while you moving and shut you from moving

Why yall niggas don't ride like I do
Slide through in that 7-4-5 blue, right beside who? Killer
Where Jones, in the pick-up truck
Yeah we use that to pick up stuff, pick up bucks
And my Denali is often parked, inside of my condo
How much did he sign for?
Oh, I bet you want to know that money
Yeah I bet you I won't show that money
I keep it stashed away, right next to the 4-4, money
Keep a lo-pro money, this is slo-mo money
I'm used to that fast crack, bag crack
Re-cook bag that, give it out, half that
If it still bags, have stacks
No more running back to me, coming back to me
I'm on the corner with a hundred packs of these
Damn, oh, he got the purple

We built this city (from bottom to top)
We built this city (through the agony and pain, diplomatic will reign)

Ay yo, my dipset Taliban
We on these streets like the wars on them streets of Afghanistan
Better yet of Pakistan
To America, Harlem's our cater
Any problems I spray her that can startle the mayor
But in this 50-block radius let's get the rock and shave the shit
or get the glock and blaze the shit
Bitches get the cock and savor it
They say Jim Jones the capo my favorite
Cause some of this shit my city wasn't built up over
Drugs and money, some shit you get killed up over
Slumped on your wheel, straight tilt it over
Trust me dogs, I seen it in peril
Niggaz wasted and painted and seen on the mural
(That's Harlem) In this apple of mine is rhyme
Clap up your shines, pop shots that will crack up your minds
And cop rocks and cook that crack up to dimes
New York City, the capital of crime
[Chorus: repeat 2X]

Now once again it's Santana the Great
I built this city on hammers and weight
Gasoline, rope, bandanas and tape
Lots of fiends, lots of coke being handed away
You know, the usual
Shut em down, set up show, how we usually do
Cut em down, hit the block man, we movin through
Diplomats is the strongest force
On and off the court we ballers more than sports
We built this city from ground zero
To spittin the pound zero, brown pistol
At ya get down kicka
Yeah this is from the ground up nigga
So get your weight and your pounds up nigga
Cause when it's beef my homies mound up quicker
Fit the pound much quicker, lay you down much quicker
You never been approached by Golden Eagles
Vultures that will scope and feed you, no court just leave you
Shit you know
[Chorus: repeat 2X]

It's like what I wouldn't do for a buck
My enemies can't rest in peace Jones, you see they funerals up
New gangstas in the city bitch, ring the alarm
All y'all hoes bow down, kiss the ring of a don
It's about to get real big playa, humongous
Stacked money so long til it grew fungus
We was gon' let you live til you threw punches
Now we got to get critical and we got to get rid of you
And we the most talked about, the most popular
We live by the codes, we the Dipset mafia
You never know who's watchin ya
You never know who's plottin to pop at ya
We focused like a pair of binoculars
I'm bout to get gritty
M-5 CLK's garage look like Alphabet City
And I'm a hustler, I put cracks in communities
Cops can't touch me, got Diplomatic Immunity
Now try I'm guaranteed a million shipped in scam
If not, back to the block, ship some grams

If not, get with Cam
I got clips to lift a van, flip a van
Shit, they can kick the can
This cat think he sling
Cause he got a pinky ring
Rinky-dink diamonds, they don't even make your pinky bling
(We built this city) And now I'm about to kill this city
(We built this city) Cradle to 50, yeah I'm acting real seditty

Homicide fingerprints, wild evidence, but what?
But thou shall, respect me bloa, bloa
Clap, clap, pow, pow, bow down, nigga
Be in Columbus never seen Bow Wow, nope

Chow and Mr. Giles lay back

Nothing, see me on fifty five, black scooped it up
A K activated, act stupid, one did act stupid
Mac had to move it, from the hood like
What's really good?
I had to lay 'em down, clip him up, sprayed around
Split him up, he played the ground, leave, nine stayed around
Outlaw on the street, shot four from the three
Southpaw Portuguese, what's really good?

Heals, sneakers, slipper stilettos
Hello, Diplomats are coming to your hood
And we wanna know, what's really good?
All my niggaz, block for block
Rock for rock, top for top
Top a top, stash your clocks under the hood
And niggaz wanna know, what's really good?
Okay I admit, I mean they said I was trippin' had to re-edit the spin
Forty four lead when I'm spitting shots to the head of my victims
Big deserts we grippin' to dry out, you in the desert is slippin'
They go through extreme measures to get 'em
Them chains and them treasures the glistening
You got three hideouts, a bed in the system
My brethren I miss them, so please tell me y'all what's really good?
Top of the drop when it's missing
My block when it's clickin'
These rocks when they glistening
What's really good?
One forty fifth on this crunk, big forty fifth in my trunk
Big gouty wrists on you chumps, what's really good?
Mostly me and sometimes them
But mostly me, oh shit man, that's one time them
Squally, so through your set up please
Let me know if you're really good
And let me know if you really hood

I like this beat, drums and bells
Remind of bullets, bodies, guns and shells
I don't talk the verse, Polly wanna cracker
When she on the stand, you probably wanna smack her
Probably wanna clap her, end your day properly
Air the shit out like the end of State Property
No run away robber, gunner stay half of me
The end I see prophecy, what's really good?
I'm in the buggy mon', with the rugby on
Air Force Ones, looking like you Lucky Charms
Lotta dudes, yelling out fuck me, uh?
I'll blow this bitch dog, what the fuck we on
It's Santana, I'm straight out the box homey
Straight to the stoop, straight to the booth
When I stepped out the box homey
I still got the sun of the box on me
Grimy clothes, funky arms, my socks dirty
I told you I can count on my boy
I'm in trouble, needed bail money, dialed on my boy
Shit and just when I thought it was getting worst
I was bailed out scot-free, spittin' this verse, uh-huh
You don't sit in the dirt, clips'll disperse

Listen close to what I say, dog, it might hurt ya
I be cuttin' ya girl while you be goin' to work bruh
When she first called my conscience was like, ""Hell naw, Fate don't""
But she said, ""I'm only around the corner"", and popped her li'l punt
Apartment 5701, told her I was eatin' right now
Be over there when I get done, got there, knocked on the door
She opened up the door half naked, lookin' exquisite
Ackin' mad 'cuz I ain't spoke to her since the last time a nigga hit it
She said, ""Don't worry forget it since 'cause we only have 30 minutes""
'Fore her man came home for lunch, so I bust my nut and raised up with
Five minutes to spare, her man unaware, I saw him in traffic
Beeped the horn and threw a deuce in the air, yeah, I'm a playa
But I feel guilty 'bout cuttin' a broad
I need counsellin' dog, 'cuz it's guilty as charged
Simply because I felt victim to lust and
Knowin' all the while it was my cousin' girlfriend I had been fuckin'
(Damn)
The court finds you guilty as charged
Your sentence is PUI school
For pimpin' under the influence, nigga
Next case
Oh, we got us a repeat offender in the house
Jenny Jones A.K.A. Shawnna
Same ol' charge, wanted in 8 states
What's yo story this time?
Oh yes, yo' honor I see we talkin' again
I have no representation now shall we begin?
I know you seen my face before but hold on my friend
It's niggas gettin' away with doin' the same shit I did
I can't do no bid, I got a mortgage and my kids in a forest by the bridge
And I drives a Rolls Royce in a porridge with dem grills
So you understand I was tryna pay me some bills
When I was flippin' outta state while I was takin' a chill
Shootin' deem and a couple friends, spend a couple ends
Took the top off of the drop and let the bubble spin
Niggas got off in my knot and let them troubles in
So I decided to put that shit in my own hands
None of these hoes can fuck me, only God judge me
That man told me he love me and he flash money
My only crime could just be livin' it filthy
So let me hear it on mo' time, not guilty
Bailiff, take her into custody
Oh, no, not my baby
Hell naw
Next case
State vs. Velvet Jones A.K.A. Ludacris
You bein' charged with impedin' ho traffic
Spendin' too much time tryna fuck one hoe

Calm down before I hold yo ass contempt of court
Ya honor, just be cool, let me approach that bench
And sprinkle seasonin' on yo ears on how I choked that beeutch
Well, did she promise you the pussy, mayn?
She certainly did I got empty McDonald's cups in my car and my crib
She owe me sumthin', bitch betta show me sumthin'
Wrap her legs around my waist and start to throw me sumthin'
I'm simply the meanest, you lookin' at the stroke of a genius
The only verdict made should be the subpoena uh this penis
No objections or appeals, let's cut us a deal
And I promise to tell the truth if my partner don't squeal
She's awfully cautious, said the jury makes her nauseous
And she said she'd suck my dick if I dropped the charges
Oh, no, time to make ya kidneys shift but didn't you fuck her best friend?
Oh, I plead the fifth
Yeah, that sound like some shit you'll say
Ol' pimp ass nigga
Due to lack of evidence, I'm droppin' the charges
Don't let me see you in here again
Let this be a lesson learned, if you don't know your player rules
You liable to violate the game and get sent away for a long, long time
Remember never hate on a real player
It ain't gon' get you nowhere, mayn
It's a lotta hoes out there player so
Ain't no reason for you to fuck ya best friend
Or ya cousin or ya brother's girl

I'm smokin dro, choppin O's
Beat knockin with the big blaze choppin nigga
I'm smokin dro, choppin O's
Ridin dirty, candy paint lookin purty
[Tity Boi]
See I'm addicted to this fast life, it's hard to slow me down
When ya, momma on the crack pipe and ya daddy ain't around
You hear the sounds of the wildest gunshots from a large clip
When we started choppin O's off in this empty apartment
See I was, standin in the track, and my back is the target
With a hammer on my side lookin like I'm layin carpets
See you flip it 'til you get it nigga, we hangin like this cable
On my way, to I-20 nigga I gotta play in Decatur
See I'm ridin and I'm blowin on twenty dollar bills
Cause we, only got that gold; you can't buy regular around here
Stayin true to the prestige and the, economic status
I still stacked 100 G's stayin in my momma's attic
Stackin under Kraft-matics, Willie sleepin on the cheese
See we got ki's and the D's and the P's and TV's
And I'm ridin in C.P. with a glock-40 as my tooley
On the block, with the top back, blowin out that
[Chorus x2]
[I-20]
You know I-20 ridin Regal's - cuttin cutters
Since my wood grains got no stains; be in some other shit
A big body Chevy on the, chrome lookin pretty
If it's dro, or the sticky I need, I'm hittin Tity
On my system knock so loud (loud) they call the cops on me
Ladies show that ass proud (proud) and make it drop for me
This is how a nigga ride (ride) in A.T.L.
And if the twelve drop pull me over (over) I hide the scales
Blowin dro out the song booth, with windows tinted
Ridin clean down Old Campbellton Road, y'all know who in it
Got my seat pushed way back, arm out the window
Niggaz quick to pull a car-jack, when they in ya
I push a Range and my brother Fate in S.S. Impala
Ludacris, with the Escalade, and Tit' quickly follow
Gettin ready for the summer get your cars out and fix it
When it comes to that ridin and smoke, look I'm addicted nigga

Yo, gotta get that monkey off my BACK.. sir
I'm smokin dro and choppin O's up in my 'LLAC.. sir
Where the fuck you at when them little bitty ""Animals ATTACK"".. sir?
I'm in the TRAP and when I get caught up in a rapture RELAX.. sir
It's like cataracts to me, actually it HAS to be
A factory of SMOKE and clouds I'm chokin proud
And rhapsody, the SACK of trees is WROTE and now
So potent now the TRACK is squeezed
So CLAP and be happy to be nappy and snappin
Just keep on rappin but nobody comes after me
POP...one hit from the blunt then I stop drop, ROLL!!
Really really want to fuck with the glock glock? NO!!
They so simple better hit that block, SLOW!!

Ain't no mistakin' Shady Park is where I'm flippin' from
It's so Shady my old lady gotta' keep a couple guns
You get the runs and I ain't talkin' about the bowel system
I'm talking bleeding, hurry wrap 'em in a towel system
Get the fuck out now system
It's animosity, curiosity, robbery
Probably the reason why theirs no stoppin' me 'till you cop a plea
Man, see now these bitches want to fuck wit Shawnna
When I bump that thang and keep a pocketbook of marijuana
Better keep that mouth out my business
'Cause I got that 50 for ya
And I'm off the whip in this bitch and somebody shoulda' told ya
I'm drinkin' Remy and these bitches lookin' at me shady
They must don't know that I'm that bitch that smoke 'em in the face
Better take me up out the club cause I'm about to break
And all bitches and thugs know how we operate
We 'bout that take nigga
[Chorus]
Little Shorty from G-Roll
On the hustle to see six figures or more
Whether rappin' or pimpin' hoes
I'm high capping the gold
And I know I made them boys sick when I popped up on 24's
You see me diggin' in my gold
I'm a ghetto bastard and when I'm smokin' on 'dro
I get the munchies directly after
I made doe by offing hoes in transactions
You see I stay on Riverdale Road
But I'll meet you up on Naston
'Cause in the south side partner we break you off proper
And the doctors can't help ya when the guns go block-ah
Time to notify the pastor ya family you'll mourn after
Yea the day after your ashes get scattered
You're all out next batter
I don't need no approval for poodles 'cause I'm a fool dog
Get to fighting in clubs and swing with pool balls
Shorty raw, walking by I try to grab sumthin'
If you don't say sumthin' I'm gon' take sumthin'
[Chorus]
Shit..
Blow you to bits and pieces
My niggas with Caprices
A Gucci bucket, Polo down with the heavy creases
I'm East Side, Scottsdale throw it up dog
I got them rocks by your block throw it up y'all
Slingers, 'dro, and pampus
Let's get it poppin' doctor
Mack 10, AK's when we shoot those choppers

Lock a nigga fuck a nigga, cop the floppin nigga

Pull the trigger bust a nigga, yellow motherfucker nigga
Ready to fill and spill a drink, I'm drunk go and weed it up

Baller niggaz thug niggaz player haters real niggaz

I'ma kick hot shit for bitches up in the industry tryin to compete me
I'm from the hood South side, West side
where niggaz'll put a motherfuckin slug in my enemy

The difference between a motherfuckin thug and a gangsta
One's thug in a chamber
Get a nigga stick a nigga put him in a ditch and then forget a nigga
Hit a nigga puck a nigga little with the rocker nigga
Puff that say you love that
We in the 'Llac and put the lemon in the 'gnac
Remy and sacks that got me scummy in the back
Puffin the raps that got me layin out slacks
and it's speakin like, ""Wow, that, blunt let me hit the weed""
Cause I been feelin like
fuck a nigga bust a nigga Shawnna never love a nigga
Chi about to show the motherfuckers how to rush a nigga
Crush that put it on momma
On everything I got e'rything for the drama, puff marijuana
To the Shawnna and put it on ya

We so relentless, you know Chi up in the business
Flows in yo' dome in an instance

There's been a cry, a crook is on the loose

Investigate, the where and why and who
Don't hesitate, you know what you must do
You've got to find the guilty party before the guilty party finds you

Guilty party, Find the guilty party
Caught up in a mystery, searching for the facts
Who knows when the villain will attack
So watch your back
The suspects all, present their alibi's
But you know one is just a pack of lies
Do not be fooled, seek out the final clue
And figure out who's story isn't true
You've got to find the guilty party before the guilty party finds you

Like I done seen em all but ain't none of them at all (like you)
And I done seen the best of the best
Baby still I ain't impressed cause ain't none of them at all (like you)
If you know how I feel when I chill
If I'm seen with a girl then she gotta be just (like you)
And baby that's the way I feel
And I got no choice but for me to keep it real
Cause when we first got together started hanging out you was
Skeptical at first had to figure out if
I was the kind of guy to try to dog you out but
I ain't that kind of guy you tried to make me out
You found out when you turned to my baby
I showed them other brothers how to treat a lady
I let you drive when I ride that Mercedes
And I ain't tripping or acting shady cause baby you know

And every time I think about you (I smile)
When you ride when you call when you come I (ride)
Your love is amazing to me
Can't wait til I see you (I wanna be wit you again)
And every time you're out on the road (I make a trip)

I give you this give you that what you need love (love)
You know I got it holla at me if you need love (love)
And affection cause I'll be your protection
Kinda hard job but I'll do it to perfection
And you can tell that I ain't trying let you go
I get with you when I can so that's how I let you know
And you be tripping cause sometimes I gotta go
But you the first one I holler to right after my shows
And I was tripping in a sense I was tense
From my body loose around you what I'ma do without you
I gotta get it together say whatever
Cause since I met you my life seems so better

You steady watching stealing but there ain't no hope man
You dealing with something bigger than the US oh man
And ain't no joking
Fresh like fat-laces and dukey ropes and I keep on smoking
Young but I'm ready so that means I'm stroking
Look at me now days girl a dog is poking
Addicted to it Jd say I got it bad
18 nigga making more than yo dad see
They think they doing it but I'ma out do em
If you know somebody like that pull up and say to em

Ye ain't riding (ye ain't riding)

Now every record that I make I'm trying to get up out the store man
Every car I drive I'm trying have you saying whoa man
Fourth album comeback power like Rogaine
Records say Columbia but I'm So So man
I stay on my grind bringing in that dough man
From records to movies now a tv show man
Anything given to me I'm goin' rep man
Big house, big cars what you expect man
Just to get a glimpse girls breaking they neck man
Blinded by the light glistening off the brake lane
Bow hot as ever I ain't lost no step
Straight t-shirt, sneakers I ain't trying to go prep
Like these lil R'n'B groups that need my help
Wish they had my style wish they had my rep
But oh no, you'll never have it like me man
And if you can't understand this is what I'm sayin

Talk around town as if I'm wit Ciara
Bow fall off nigga that'll be never
I'm rich (yea I'm rich) I can do whatever
I get a kick outta shutting suckers down in the parking lot
Especially when they trying to stunt thinking they hot
All out the window talking loud like they running my block
That's when I come through (come through) and all that stop
And ain't another younger keep it fresh like dis man
Every year, same time come wit them hits man
Tired of making girls fall out wit a kiss man
Well listen and you're stuck music just like quick sand
Older people say that lil young dude sick man
Young A.I. and we crew thick man
Difference between me and you is you be bricklin
And I ain't never ever done that before (no)

On a mission wishing upon a star young boweezy with the caviar.
In the back of a limo no demo this is the real breaking niggas down like Evander Hollyfeild.
I might come to your town shut a show down
Got the whole crowd screaming lil bow wow.
Without the lil but I'm still on top back
With sad record sales won't flop (nah)
That's what you thought but I'm in that
New Porsche no box earrings chain on no
Watch (that's big) picture a grandfather clock with diamonds,
That's just the kinda mind state that I'm in.
Caviar, Cartier, carter-drop on my neck call her dear cute shorty called lenier (come here).
I'm on my P's and my Q's stones green to the blue 23's when I cruise.
Feel my calf muscle on my brake pedal ain't another younging on my bank level (where you at?).
I'm right here never late please see clear its no blur yes sir.
[Chorus: x2]
I'm on leer jets,
Know what make your face from your tears wet while you rocking last years sweats.
Swag yeah I got it Prada bags for my luggage,
Face on screen for everything I does in the public.
Boy wonder, make the other boys wonder how we keep it
Coming different every summer.
Don't be amazed cause of me,
Be amazed cause the v came with a five year opped out lease (yea)
That's cause I paid what I paid if you
Paid like I'm paid den yo cribs came wit the maids
And if it didn't den you slipping catch up but by the time you do I'll probably do it different.

Shooting niggas down, slapping bitches up, straight cash strut with some heny in my cup.
Rude for the hell of it, I should be the president hey yo homey
Doggy dogg got the medicine (where, where?) in the cabinet,
I'm the magnet, of attracting the badest bitches on the planet dig it.
I once was a pup never scared to run up I did it till the day I came up and stars do shine,
I take my 32 lines and try to make you unwind first I,
Chop um and den some, flop um den flip um, break um and bend um,
Den fix um convince them to buy my records
Cause you know its all hits spread the word cause you know its the shit! Quit
Playing go get it quit hesitating its the young and the big on the real my nig.

big-dreams,2005,bow-wow,Hip-Hop,"Its not me exactly, that touches people
Its what I represent
The possibility that dreams long ago, may still come true
Even if they look lost forever
I had a homie named Tony, 16, 6'2
Headed to the NBA straight from high school
My nigga had his ball game on lock
But at the same time he was in love wit the block
All the stuff that came wit it, the drugs and the guns
The gangs, the slang, and all the funds
He just got a letter of intent from the Cavaliers
Sayin' how they love'em and they wish he was there
He had it made like special-ed, about to get the bread
But chose to do somethin' dumb instead
Go to war wit the crew on the other side of town
And was mo ready, and Tony got laid down
He ain't even have a chance
Died for the ambulance even got to'em
So many went through'em
I hate ta tell the story but that's how it is
Growin' up in the hood as a kid
[Chorus: x2]
When you got big dreams,
Don't listen to what nobody say
And don't let nobody turn you away
When you got big dreams,
Keep ya eyes on the prize don't fall to the way side
I know a girl name Gina
That was a hell of a singer
And everybody fell in love wit her when they seen her
Baby girl was on a verge of signing a big deal
18, and life looked so-so real
She was stuck wit a dude that was all bad news
And all he ever did was give baby the blues
But she was true to a nigga
Do for a nigga
Pop you and ya whole crew for a nigga
One night he came picked her up, told her lets ride
That's the same night that he watched her die
They was trying to hit a lick, but the lick hit back
Put a end ta the deal, and all of that
She ain't even have to be there, he know it wasn't right
Now he gotta deal wit for the rest of his life
And the part I don't like, he ain't even get grazed
But the home girl Gina, is layin' in the grave
[Chorus]
I got a few relatives that give the family drama
Always got they hand out when they see me and my momma
One could of been a doctor, the other a chef
But when he got his own kitchen he was cookin' something else
Now his life in the drain
A trifling shame
He all washed up
Wife took everything
No car, no mo, no house
And everywhere he go he stole, so they throwed him out
I was growin' lookin' up to be like them
Now I''m throwin' up cash, rollin' up in a Bent
I was stuck wit a dream I had as a shortie
I'll be damned if I let another man support me
Now, uncle June Buck sit, skinny as hell
He got AIDS in his body from the needles he shared
Every time he get his welfare checks,he don't care
If you want to see him got to the crack house, he there
[Chorus]
When you got big dreams [Repeat: x4]
Keep ya eyes on the prize, don't fall tot the way side"

Freeze
Still the juvenile at 400 degrees
Lil girls still falling out
I'm still balling
Crawling out the hottes B's on these ATL streets
From the garden to the box office
I shuts down both
And it don't matter where I go
I'm still O-H-I-O
Everybody know this is my turf
Who had it crunk first
And had girls at all ages off one verse
You
And nobody else can name
Another 17 year old mane
That do it this hard so hard
That's what them old niggas say about me
Young niggas play can't go a day without me
If the bling was a drug
I'd die from an overdose
Fresh princes sugar loaf
Homie I'm the most you've seen
I got the same affects on both coasts
And everything hot on fur wheels
Homie I'm ghost

Stop trying to do what you see

I would never wanna be one

Everybody in town like it don't worry bout nobody else

The whole industry the same
Everybody wanna sound and look like the next mane
But I'm definite there ain't another me
And I'm so so def'n it
Back wit JD
Back to give these lil' imitators
Something to talk on
Breath stretch let it go

Can't forget Right On
A lot of things changed since the young don's been gone
Who else you goin' roll with
The future is me
Only young'n that's moving units
Is um, me
Young Ali
Float like a butterfly
Get up out them stores quick
Why wouldn't you wanna buy
The carbon copy not the copy
Imitators mimic but them guys is sloppy
As for me I'm the leader of the new school
I can just adjust so the rest of y'all just
Do you

See
It's rare that you are people like us
Everybody out there doing what I'm doing

Cause I stay trying to find me a pretty young thing
That I call anytime if she ready to hang
And if sun'it jump off she be ready to bang

To graduate short shirts ed'day trying t show they little shape
Low cut jump jeans Lugz on hea feet

In a party she the main one doing that right there
Every time he a jam drop hands up in the air.
And she ain't thinking you, she ain't thinking bout he a here
And if you balling homie she don't even really curr

And she ain't come alone she got her whole little crew.

Sounds like a good way to build up my infamy

He headed over to receive our registration forms from the galactic embassy
'Yes may I help you?'
Remember me?
To escape a global panic we had to intercede
'Oh, you're here for the battleforms?'
Yeah, can we get them for free?
'I'm afraid not, you'll have to pay the intrance fee.'
It was worth a try
When we first arrived on Mercury
Gravity adjustment was a must an
Step up contestant
Number 12 I was 13
He started bursting
Ammunition that was'nt working
His rudimentary technical abilities couldn't kill me
Knocked me for a loop, but I could still breathe
He had the crowd going by appearance
Here comes the anticipated interference from his squad and gods
I bust back with an onslaught of hydrothermiclyde
To burn their third eye
Tho outnumbered I come wit heat
And trigger a massive explosion to the beat
They hit me with compressed air left my chest bare
My sonic stun gun takes em out by the next snare
(Blowin' my mind)
We won the bout
Just as the oxygen tanks were runnin out
So we're back to the ship
Pull a map from our blip
Manipulate the cursor
Recharge our essentals
Set the coordanants then flow
Through a trillion miles of space
With style and grace
Next stop Pluto to rock these new flows
Atmosphere, methane
Be strategic like a chess game
Leave this emcee with chest pains
I had to battle a shadow in his black light form
He dazzled me, adding three points to his score
Engulfed the microphone with darkness added three more
The panel started to roar
I had to find the core of his power
He streached his text, causing me to blackout
It took my dat out
I couldn't back out
It took out the sound man
I'm takin' a poundin
I bust out an a cappella that's astoundin
Project a unibeam through his spleen
Pulled out my x-ray cannon to disinigrate the phantom
Its night finite cell structure ruptured
His form began to bust up into clustas
Shadowy masses spread to the greater darkness of outer space
Now I'm placed first among artists
(Blowin my mind)
(Blowin my mind)
Serve due
More space travel, Computer
'Yes Deltron'
What have you?
Next destination?
'The colony of Cecilia on [Arthgolano]'
This is apealin
Hyperspace
With mic in place
We was off
Breathin frost in the void
Thinkin what if we are lost
Ha! Entertaining ignorant thought
Land ho!!
Cecilia, we entered the port
Fill out a few forms then we meet our chalanga
Named Q-zar
'No matter who you are I'll handle ya!!'
He's a real charmer
I threw on my plasteel armor
He wants to absorb all the talents I worked so hard for
A biter hard core
I busted a fiew shots and opened him like a car door
He was a quadraped, four arms
He hit me with four four arms full of bronze
I said ""Automator play the song""
(you got it)
It was the theme
Made a slight alteration in my scheme
Set him up with a comition beam
With his double team
Leaned toward his dome piece
Seremed the back of his neck
With a cranial disruption syphon
Squeezed out his brain like juice
Like a python

Every whim is enforced
I send men with torches to raid your fortress
And in the process radiate your optics
Subconsciously haunt emcees
Super human technician atomic inner dimension
Too mental with intuition
Typographical aptitude let my lasers clap at you
Mapped the route, psychologically crappin' out,
What you laughing bout?
Imitations getting penetrated in free simulations
In my MC's training class remain in mass
Never get liquidated convert energy
Into matter instantly, with a pen and pad
Calculate the Sinograph, heat the center of gravity
Abolish apathy graphically packing three eighty's
With body heat sensitive bullets you need safety
Fest on your face and neck
Mental armory levitate legs for my monarchy
No malarkey my flows embarking
Zionically sparking brain cells til they're sparkling
Zionically sparking brain cells til they're sparkling
No one knows the time passing by.
I remake my universe every time I use a verse
To fulfill my destiny, emcees rest in peace
Side barriers provide care within

I subjugate you other fake performers while the bass of your face"

I want y'all to meet deltron zero, hero, not no small feat
It's all heat in this day and age,
I rage your grave,
Anything it takes to save the day
Nueromancer, perfect blend of technology and magic
Use my rappin so you all could see the hazards
Plus entertainment where many are brainless
We cultivated the lost art of study and I brought a buddy
Automator harder slayer fascinating combinations
Cyber warlords are activating abominations
Arm a nation with hatred we ain't with that
We high-tech archeologists searching for nicknacks
Composing musical [stimpacks?] that impacts the song
Crack the motor what you think you rappin for?
I used to be a mech soldier but I didn't respect orders
I had to step forward, tell them this ain't for us
Living in a post-apocalyptic world morbid and horrid
The secrets of the past they horded
Now we just borded on a futuristic spacecraft
No mistakes black its our music we must take back
Yo it's three thousand thirty,

I wrote this in jail playing host to a cell
For the pure verbal, they said my sentance was equivalent to murder
Just another hurdle, I bounced through a portal
I knew they had the mindstate of mere mortals
My ears morphed to receptors to catch ya
Every word about gravity control
And the families they hold for handsome ransoms
On the run with a handgun blast bioforms, I am more
Than a planetwide manhunt with cannons
Will make me abandon my foolish plan of uprising
Fuck dying I hijack a mech
Controlling with my magical chance so battle advance
Through centuries a hip hop legacy, megaspeed
Hyperwarp to automator's crib and light the torch
They can't fight the force,
Victory is ours once we strike the source
Enterprising wise men look to the horizon
Thinking more capitalism is the wisdom
And in prison all citizens in power with rhythm
We keep the funk alive by talking with idioms

Medieval prehistoric rhetoric well we ahead of that
Lay it down with soundwaves that pound pavement
Original menstrals my central processing unit
Is in tune with my heart for this art
Not artificial 'cause that makes it hard to miss you
Copy cats finish last in the human race
Staying glued to safes to prude to take a buddah brak
We got [espers] that let us bless with fresh shit
Undetected by yes men questing for five fleeting nanoseconds of fame
Protecting the brain from conspiracies against my cosmos
While I float to neo-tokyo with opio
Or discuss combusitible rust clusters with plus
Evade cyber police in a computer crib confuse the kids
But I can make a kickin rhymes that's sacred
Telepathic mind that takes its greatness from the matrix [esper]
Rhyme professor rushes in ultra pressures with correction measures
Why half the worlds a desert
Canibals eat human brains for dessert
Buried under deap dirt, mobility innert
I insert these codes for the cataclysm
Ever since I had the vision use my magnitism
In this modern metropolis they tries to lock us up
Under preposterous laws that's not for us

I just won 10 grand in the Galactic
Rhyme Federation championship, so I'm lampin' a bit
I feel like returnin' to Earth and burnin' some herb
I'm sick of lookin' at the inside of space stations
Time for Deltron to take a vacation
My expertise in aviation got us to our destination (where?)
The East Bay
My living quarters is completely froze solid
I thaw it out with a heat ray
Now I'm chillin' in a sauna, pulsating jet streams
Peeping out in virtual reality my wet dreams
Perusing my 21st century classic comics, the fun is astronomic
(Ha ha ha) I figured since I'm here I'll renew my galactic passport
So I'm not persecuted by no galactic assholes
Schemers on the ave
With their holographic hat-tricks
Using magnetism to pick-pocket citizens
Tourists walk around with memory apprehension glasses
They attempt to capture
The past tense
Virtual junkies, burnt out and lost
War veterans still trapped in the Holocaust
Yes I know all the answers
Living in my true love's arms
I'm sittin' on the porch readin' Cosmopolitan
Peepin' all these dumb hoes with enhanced collagen
I'm calling in sick today
Big mistake
This resulted in a final pay check and pink slip ?
Replaced by my successor cause I missed my place
Knowin' that the Rhyme Federation will miss my face
(Fuck why'all)
Referred to as a big disgrace
Now I'm free-lance with more risk to take
Now a rhymin' merc, finding certified androids
Hit a convention, signin' autographs for fan-boys
They admire
My enhanced stanzas
And how I dodge man-hunts
And security cameras
Avoided apprehension in sub-atomic dimensions
And even more impressive cause of what we livin
A self contained environment, I suggest I'm just a minor threat
I see a thing of beauty fly as heck, standing by her desk
Paid her my respects, I was too scared to try to step
So I deployed one of my androids with dialect
Synthesized with my voice perfectly replicated
Asked for her name, and was she married?
""No we're separated""
*Booty*
Baby baby you're looking real fine
Your behind, you got 3 booty cheeks
That's kind of unique for for a ?
What say me and you hit the hot spot over at your house ?
I got a few sandwiches ? eaten
Yo it's cool though, you got one eye ? trippin' though
Listen you, me and you, we gon' ?, we gon' far, go all the way to Mars
Venus we'll go to Venus if you want to

Crashin space craft, I'm bio-enhanced
Hiero advanced series, monstrous evolution
Headed, tooth and nail, scoop the trail
Super-sleuth, a new race
Mad creator, savage nature
World Wide Web, the ebb and flow
Light years from watchful eyes while my thoughts
Provide
Objective, ? pompous prophecies
Underground societies are ?
Asteroid surfing, castor-oil burping
The darkest side of humanity animated
The grand awakening, plan to take it in
I demand your patronage, mobilize my battletanks
With clusters small, empty ?

Verbal war with weapons, installation
Blowin' the star dust, distance twelve parsecs
Enthuse your phalanx with my literary talents
Just a bit of balance, rip the silence
In space, all-star systems are our victims
Atomics, anonymous with ominous
Implications of information,
Or information, and entertainment
Cyber-tech dialect, you gotta earn my respect
I'm like grammar or to amateurs, hit em with a
Cannonball
And in all this confusion, the fusion of music and
Mind
Precipitates translucent illusions
Search the ruins with Automator
Hit the walls with a carbonator
Hit-or-missiles, just regenerate
The sonic soldiers allow us to demonstrate
Emergency dispatch, skyscrapers rip back
From the impact, their flow is mismatched
My style's protected by heat shields and ceramics
Don't panic, I landed on planet Mercury
Gave it atmosphere, set up my headquarters
I'll never get captured here
Rap your tear ? clap your ear ? with Solesonic
Mantronic phonics
Turn your brain to an omelette
I'll hold a comet in bondage, with my dominance
Take a space shuttle to escape trouble
Bounce through the Milky Way

I must appeal to you people with your faculties

The universe is one and I can see what rap can be glorious
Put in the Smithsonian my podiums for holy hymns
But you see who's controlling them
Fuck myself off 'cause of the egotistical mode I'm in
No I can't slap you no five
When you and your cutty is talkin' shit about me outside
People take pride in what they have no hand in
Sorta like a phantom holographic handsome
But deep inside he wants to do what his man done
Just because his peers jeer and and clown
When your six foot deep no one hears you now
They say were not compatible like deers and cows and owls
So many rules and regulations say you're not allowed
I'm caught in the grip of the city, madness [Repeat x4]

Opposite or positive

Where every leak or info is hard to swallow
Sell your Marlboros and car insurance
Put niggas on the moon and can't pay your burdens
I smoke herb and rock a turban
Meditate on the world and what's occurrin'
A lot of white boys like the style and copy
Dig in something deeper and you'll peep that were not free
It's not about the separation its about the population
I'm caught in the grip of the city, madness [Repeat x4]
Simple minded people always point the finger
To bring it to a close as if life is their role, their path
When all paths are intersections
It all depends on the persons perception
When I'm mad as fuck you get shot
And to some it's bad luck
I believe you held something back for too long
It grew strong
And energy got its own will
And people think they make music still
But music is there with out you or me we just manipulate
For better or worse so let it situate
I get to make records and dough
Paid out the ass hole
And still seen as another face on the totem pole
Conquer, my sponsors are monsters
And everybody thinks that I owe them one
I'm glad I love music and life
Cause it's easy to see the pain and strife and end it all tonight

That helps you to keep composure, up around your folk
That keeps from trying to wrap a rope, around your throat

Life isn't a million bucks, you feeling like living sucks
God's telling you hear your boy, but you don't wanna give him trust
Mama telling you pay your tithes, and you yell at her back, ""for what""

Trying to focus on the road that's ahead of me
Till my brain gets cloudy bout a memory
God knows, how I feel now
On the outside I'm smiling, but inside a nigga know he hell bound
It's a dark road, and I'm right here in the middle of it
Do I walk slow or if I run, am I'm missing some'ing
I took the time out, to save a little bread
Now my eyes, got water in em
Why the fuck am I still standing here, nobody love me I ain't happy here
My mama said, she can't handle him
But still, I'm looking at the bright side
But I view it through my other eye, cause it's a different color sky
Then the last one, my mind set on the prize that may never come
So do I try to stay alive, or do I grab a gun
End it all, put a stop to the pain
That goes on in my head, everytime it rains
But that was speaking, so you listening to the thoughts
Of an evil spirit, in demonic verses everytime I talk
I'm confused, by my psychological set backs
In the storm, washin out through the wet cracks
Looking for heaven, off in all the wrong places
I've given up so why the long faces? Let it rain
Your bills keep adding up, to be alone you prefer
Bill collectors steady calling, starting to get on your nerves
Your rent due on the first, but right now it's the third
Telling yourself it's gon get better, but ain't believing a word
Feel like it's hard to deal, tomorrow it's hard as steel
Not to mention the realest member, of your family is getting ill
Tell me it isn't so, tell me it isn't real
In the mist of all the drama, you take a lil' time to kneel
To deal you take a pill, just to deal with the drama
You thinking your life sinking, and there isn't a plumber
They tell you what doesn't kill you, only makes you stronger
You'd have to be a Superman, to live as much as me partna
you're trying, but help is just what you dialing
Cause the room is a monsoon, that's never gon get to drying
The storm is moving on, and you thinking these people lying
They saying they had it worse, but how come they all keep on smiling
Don't let stress take control, gonna be alright I know
I'ma make it through fa sho, fa sho yeah - 2x
My memry, heeeey-heeey yeah
Stressing me-stressing me, my memories
That's what they telling me
I'm trying to focus on the road that's ahead of me
By my memories, yeah heeey yeeeah
When it seems like nothing but dark clouds
Are raining in on your bright, sunny day
Remember, the sunlight always comes after the rain
You should be thankful, everyday
should be a celebration of life."

See me shinin, you should picture me rollin
because I'm doin good
[Verse 1]
Yeah, I was just walkin this (yes), while y'all was talkin this
Burnin up the bootleg market, like I'm an arsonist (yes)
Had to get smart with this (yes), studied and sharpened it
Plot gets darker than the thoughts in a coffin get
Remember I walked into L.A. Reid's offices (yes)
Had to walk outta there feelin like I was not the ish
But they didn't owe me nothin (yes), gave me no promises
But the industry still gonna see me, I promise this
Universal Records (yes), I'm wreckin all the lists (yes)
The crane can't even lift all my accomplishments
Even when I was indie, was bringin y'all the hits
Actin like I was crazy, I got a conscience kid
In a interview they would say you look kinda pissed
Up against the world, middle finger for all the continents (yes)
F. Koopa, what's the best of my compliments?
Indie label, the hell with slavery, I'm all for this (yes)
Like this the damn thanks I get
and thank you, I'ma just focus on the bank I get
Used to be with Paid and Swisha, but I made my ""Click""
The game greazy, that's the reason why I think I'm slick (yes)
Lets take it back to the beginning, when I wasn't winnin
With women and gold grinnin, my pockets were so thin and
Chamillion, before the million, no candy and chrome spinnin
Amazing how things still go sour, with no lemon
I'm poor baby, of course little nigga tacky
My Jordans isn't matchin, of course my little hair was nappy
I remember how the rest of the boys was lookin at me
The day that I got cut from the core, like it made 'em happy
Cause your spot is yours (yours), now my locker gettin clean
Not good enough for my team, not good enough for my dream (what?)
Exactly what it is a dream, I acted like a triple beam
Was under the rap game and I turned it into a scheme (yes)
Now when they speak on me, they say it's about the
time that he's got his props, hate when these niggaz doubt me
Now your with your spouse, she used to diss me and now she
missin teeth, lookin like she been kissin on coffee (yes)
I should take your confidence, throw it up in the air and gun it down (down)
But I don't knowin that was goes around, always comes around
Now everybody wanna come around, givin a brother sound
Now you speak just cause you seein how Koopa run it now

Yeah-yeah-yeah, and I mean that there
And I mean that there, and I mean that there yeah-yeah
Not a angel I'm filled with anger, to the industry I'm a danger
They make friends with dick suckers, said they tell you that I'm a stranger
Kick some dirt on my name, but really how can I blame you
I'm the next to blow, so they put me on punishment for bad behavior
They said I should, off went major, but I'm a procrastinator
I get the job done playa, but I'm busy now ask me later
Stay with a calculator, my lawyer get a grand retainer
Why 'cause I'm a better business man, than your average hater
But now I wanna ask a favor, don't talk to me like I'm stupid
Got no love for you haters, so send that message to cupid
Give a shout out to Who Kid, why give a shout out to Who Kid
'Cause I'm wearing something, that match the size of a G-Unit shoe kid
What's that, a nine stupid, you do the math why
I tried to be nice to the dyke, but that was my last try
And since it seems the industry, is infatuated with the bad guy
I'm spitting and pissing on gimmick niggaz, when they pass by
Get mad that I get green, you dealing with the Hulk
I put my anger in the music, nigga this is the result
Did a hundred thousand independent, now I move CD's in bulk
Check on Chamillionaire.com, my fan base is a cult
I'm that nigga that'll spot you, see you in the streets and box you
You acting like you a problem, I bet I do something 'bout you
Run the South when it come to making mix tapes, I'm a monster
Napster crashed, but I wanna give a special shout out to Kazaa
Long as Lil' Jon, and Manny keep making beats
Chamillionaire gon' be a ghetto millionaire, in these streets
I speak my mind, so stop acting so sentimental
You soft, if you go to jail you'll get used for a prison pillow
You scared, shooting slugs behind the bushes and not a brick
Like a bush is gon' protect you, you know who you dealing with
Chamillitary hideous mood, and I pity the fool
If I walk in, I bet every sissy in the city'd move
Ain't got to walk a city for food, like Diddy did dude
If you hungry for drama, I'll see that my Semi get chewed
Give me the tool I'm from Texas, but I ain't no damn bammer
Mess with Killa Mike, Ron Thomas that Quo down in Atlanta
Lil' Flip and my man Banner, come here and get man handled
By Slim, E.S.G., OG Ron C fix your damn channel
If you think we all right thur, and speaking with bad grammar
I know Bun B, Lil' O and S.U.C. ain't no damn bammers
Rasaq ain't no damn bammer, Play-N-Skillz ain't no damn bammers
The clip in the hand jammer, to use it for a damn hammer
Hit you on top of your head, and leave humps like a tan camel
Keep a couch with a full house, like Dan Tanner
That's plenty of bricks, that's plenty of chips
There's plenty of fine groupies, there's plenty of chicks
Like dominatrix chicks, there's plenty of whips
So you bricks can do a flip, off the end of my dick
Get off the end of my tip, nigga you a crash test dummy
You album dropped you smile and frown, after the math get funny
I'm getting all my publishing, never had that kept from me
I'm buying Color Changin' vehicles, with my ass cap money
Promises that they gave you, made you feel like you major
Navigator and two-way pager, they gave you then made you
Go lie about how they paid you, and never will play you
You's a puppet go get a refund, I think that they played you
You album was whack huh, it's still on the rack huh
Repo man hopped in your vehicle, they took it back huh
You go get a dagger, then hop in a cab huh
You looking for a A and R or CEO, you can stab huh
Did a hundred thousand independent, ain't really nothing to prove
I make a million disappear, quicker than Nelly with jewels
See the industry wouldn't listen, so I stopped being a humble guy
Now I'm the come get it, if you ready to royal rumble guy
And I mean that there, and I mean that there
And I mean that there yeah

They didn't know that eventually I'd be the one to worry about
When someone would mention me, they always tried to say I would flop
But this the sound of revenge
Yea
On the path to find out who's true
The only person you can really trust is you
And if you feel like you can't even trust you
Then you can always trust you know who
And if you don't know who you know who is
Then I feel so sorry for you
Cause that's really the only person that can judge you
Critics, people that wanna see you fail will tell you what you can't do
Shouldn't do and must do
But when you got that glow
Nobody else's words can really budge you
Revenge has always been looked upon as a sin
And sometimes you feel like you had to sin to win
Sometime it sound like :gunshot:
Is what it coulda been
When you get to the gates of Heaven they probably wouldn't let ya in
But ya change that meanin' up and success is what it is in the end
And instead of worryin' about what shoulda, coulda, woulda been
Ya turn your head toward the future and keep it movin'
Know what I'm sayin'?
Well say it again
Keep it movin'
Know what I'm sayin'?
Screw it then
Know what I'm sayin?
If you're waitin' for me to fail, your time is runnin' out on that clock
I'm runnin' to the finish yea, when I get there I ain't gonna stop
Success is what I couldn't have, but now I tell em look what I got
It's the sound of revenge"

Excuse me, polo when I be dressed
Rose gold around my neck, fingers throwin' up my set ehh-ehh
Pourin' up the cut, open up the trunk
Strip out the inside man, I'm showin' up on buck (Aoww!)
I'm so cool, the paint so wet
Chrome women on my hood look like she divin' in a pool
I be ridin' with the tool, I be draped in diamond jewels
When it's drama I'ma dummy, look don't make me turn to fool
Them other boys cool, but they ain't me
I'm the throwdest rhyme boy that ya eyes gon' see
Uh, My chain look like a box of cereal
Lucky Charms on my arms look like some frosted material
Yeah..I want 300 M
You want the kind you sit in, I want the kind you spend in
Paint changin' blendin', rims swangin' spinnin'
til' them thangs is bendin', leavin' stains and drippin'
I be comin' down, boys say what does that mean
But they soon get the picture when they see them TV screens
..These boys ain't messin' with the flow
Nigga, I'm the issh, like you messed up on the floor
Ha, you know the flow is so professional
Cham' is the next to go, that means that I'm the next to blow!
Before this, we been dressin' 24's
We put buttons on our rims, when we steppin' out the door

Yeah, got a girl in Dallas, she love Pappa though
She be calling me up, Koopa let's eat
Sorry, but I got a radio interview to do
I gotta hook up with Milla Mack and Greg Street
Maybe we can retreat to get a bite to eat
Take a night to sneak to a tightless suite
You can invite some freaks but get it right, I'm cheap
I won't pay you could leave, with tonight's receipt
I'm in Alabama or Louisiana
Ke'Noe and Dobey, BeBe and Jabber
When I'm not in the lab, you know I'm trying to grab a
Couple G's chick please, what are you getting mad for

hip-hop-warning,2005,chamillionaire,Hip-Hop,"[Intro]
I don't really know if it's dead or alive
They called for an ambulance
They said one of them won't be able to make 'til March 27
But in the mean time I'll give it a check up
[Chorus - 2X]
Hip-hop just died here's a warning
(somebody ring the alarm)
Hip=hop just died here's a warning
(somebody ring the alarm)
Hip-hop just died here's a warning
That revenge is coming (It's coming back for..)
(It's coming back for revenge)
[Chamillionaire talking over chorus]
Man I don't even know if hip-hop is dead
But I do know that some of the bigest retails stores is going out of business
Record sales ain't doing what they use to do
Remember when you use to be able to go 4, 5 million sold
Now everybody having trouble to go gold man
It's a lot of good music coming out the south
And a lot of non-sense coming out the south
But I can't blame no artist
I blame corporate america for the downfall of rap
[Chamillionaire]
If hip-hop should die before I'm great (yea)
I'ma do more than just murder a mixtape
I'ma do more than just murder a mixtape
I'ma do more than just murder a mixtape (chea)
Pollution I smell that in the breeze
But let's try not to get mad at the trees
Tell 'em all not to get mad at the leaves
Let's get mad at the idiots that planted the seeds
When it come to mixtapes, I'm know as the Messiah
I influence these other rappers to get tighter
Go to every label and murder the checkwriter
Who ever hired him, we should prey that he will get fired
And soon as they kick him out on Broadway
Show him how to make his hip-hop the hard way
I bring the whole south with me, you should just call me
And we can make a pinata out of him all day
Chea, and I ain't even finna be gentle
You can murder Seline for sending me the instrumental
It ain't coincidental how they can get in your mental
Then the minute you see it they tell you it was accidental (accidental)
All rich rappers do is complain, everybody arguing to be on top of the game
9 out of 10 rap about copping them thangs
Or how the gat go braat, braat, braat, braat when it bang
And it seems like H-town got that popular slang
Platinum grills everybody else copping the same
Platinum grills everybody else copping the same
Then everybody run to that like it's the poppinest thang
What is that man? Where the hell your swagger at?
Who gon be the first to bring the old swagger back?
Doing what I do seems like boys mad at that
You was sharp homie, where the hell is your dagger at?
I was a fan sitting up in the stands
When it was M-E-T-H-O-D MAN
You hear M-E-T-H-O-D for Cham
Rakim was still thinking of a master plan
And it worked, and now I'ma fit up in my place
Stay humble, stay focused, and show that I got grace
You better not point the burner to my face
Better load up the burner and then turn it to myspace
The same rapper than die hard, Bruce Willis with a vest under the Izod
Wanna beat you? Man I ain't got to try hard
You getting beat by the Internet and your Ipod
The label don't want you to be Master P
Took the Master and put it right after P
Bump it master, but I won't let it master me
You're an idiot if you're giving up your masters free
Corporate America is f-ing up the rap game
While we argue about which rapper got the phat chain
You real gangsta you pulling out your gat man
The real gangsta who ever own the rap name
Like Busta said ""you should give a performance""
That's the truth us rappers shouldn't try and avoid it
If you're married the game go ahead and divorce it
Especially if it's rap we ain't even enjoying it
Yea I'am not going to point a ""K"" at a magazine
Because of what someone say in a magazine
I can..pull out my chain yellin 'Bada Bling'
Or on a G4 plane sitting by the wing
Telling you ""the leather feel good don't it?""
For 50 thou you'll have a real good moment
The plane's landed by the pilot that flown it
I am not an idiot cause I'm trying to own it
Little kids look at me and say that ""you best""
1.3 million in the U.S. some label exec gettting in a new desk
I get an award they tell me that I'm too blessed
Honestly it just excited my family
I just hide the medicine inside of the candy
Get cured by the music blasting out of your camry
If not I'll hide the medicine inside of your brandy
Cuz I know that yall boys gotta be drunk
To think that Chamillionaire gonna be a industry punk
I'm a in-da-streets problem you will get stomped
Get criss-cross off when the kid jump
Some of them try to rhyme but they can't rhyme like this (Jump)
Some of them try to rhyme but they can't rhyme like this (Jump)
Some of them try to rhyme but they can't rhyme like this (Jump)
Some of them try to rhyme but they can't
Because I'm the miggity miggity mack that stacks the plat plaques
But rap is so wack so I'm back to spit crack
March 27th I'm back and that's fact
So rappers that can't rap get ready cuz it's a wrap"
void-in-my-life,2005,chamillionaire,Hip-Hop,"[Chorus]
When I look back at my life, I realize-realize something ain't right
I'm missing you Lord, in my life make it right
I got something to decide, just wanna make-wanna make everything right
Cause there's a huge void, a huge void in my life make it right
I'm staring up at the Pope, it soak it up while he spoke it
Mesmerized and repeated, like he the author that wrote it
The broads are the ones I love, just don't wanna be the corporate
So waiting for death to approach this, take the time to say no sis
I don't hate ya, for having these little seeds
At seventeen, best believe they're a beautiful breeze
Of fresh air when there's nothing else, I usually need
Just a smile look at em now, hoping you just believe
And my broad been in place forever, I'm gone but I'm chasing cheddar
Been gone could of kept it going, with a poem or a basic letter
But naw I just hate to tell her, try hard but I didn't let her
The groupies get at your boy, but you're my Cinderella
Look girl we can make it better, but there's a gift and a curse
While you healing a nigga feelings, yours are usually hurt
It ain't amount of cash on Earth, to match what you really worth
Know your turf has been the church, that's where you put in work
And you put in overtime, because you know the sign
And most danger that I've been lately, rap is mo' than rhymes
But you still hold me down, I'ma do way mo' this time
Got some time that I need to manage, girl you know that's right
And that's speakin' like a true deacon, cause even to see you sleeping
That comfortably ain't enough for me, anything that you needing
I'll cease anything that squeaks, and cease any sink that leaks
Ain't nothing gon interrupt, your sleep deep into them sheets and peep
[Chorus]
How your father call the police, have your mama put in the jail
When the arguments always started, and ended up in a cell
Hard to it was the thought of this, ring that you use to wear
As I darted out the apartment, and pawned it to get the bail
Argument after argument, drama wasn't hitting well
Target it ain't no harm in it, smart so I didn't tell
God that it was the hardest, yeah life was a living hell
Spent part of it steady dodging it, charging off in the trails
Father say he a Muslim, your mama say she a Christian
The Bible or the Koran, which one would you be picking
The cards are in your palm, ain't really no use in tripping
Be true to the one you choose, ain't really no use in switching
Yeah they gon' have to be mad at us, choice is something I had to trust
Standing up when I had enough, for my blessings not adding up
Take too many things for granted, right after that metal bust
Somebody's life is missing, that's when the spirit grabbing us
[Chorus]
A religion is what you missing, someone tell me how can it
Make people panic, mention God and all the weak people vanish
Take God your woman and your family, even your own life for granted
Until you slanted on the planet, with your face in the granite
And I won't have it, I don't wanna see my coaching divided
So I decided to remind it, there's a choice and provide it
So put your ego to the side, soon as you standing beside it
Raise your right hand, and let the spirit know it's invited
Don't need to fight it, I just wanna make it right 'fore they bury me
Cause the truth is like therapy, plus my conscience is tearing me
Into pieces as deadly was dealt, was not even fair to me
To the soldiers that passed in the game, we missing you terribly
Thank my family especially, in my mind like telepathy
Staying humble is the recipe, keep my faith and he blessing me
I use the energy left in me, to make sure they respecting me
Walk the steps of my destiny, like I know he protecting me
I'm a leader, believe the people won't get to see less of me
No they won't see the death of me, or no police arresting me
I live life so successfully, and just show em the best of me
On another level mentally, this position was meant for me

I'm tint so it ain't easy to be seen
When you see me ride by they can see the glean
And my shine on the deck and the TV screen
Ride with a new chick, she like hold up
Next to the play-station controller is a full clip and my pistola
Turn a jacker into a coma
Girl you ain't know, I'm crazy like Krayzie Bone
Just tryin to bone ain't tryin' to have no babies
Rock clean as hell so I pull in ladies
Laws on patrolling you know they hate me
Music turned all the way up until the maximum
I can speak for some niggas tryin to jack for some
But we packin' somethin' that we have
And um will have a nigga locked up in the maximum
Security cell, I'm grippin' oak
Music loud and tippin' slow
Twin steady twistin' like hit this dough
Police pull up right behind and it's in his throat
Windows down gotta stop pollution

I got a revolver in my right hand, 40 oz on my lap freezing my balls
Roll a nigga tree, green leaves and all
Comin' pretty deep, me and my dogs
I gotta get back to back streets
Wanted by the six pound and I got heat
Glock glock shots to the block we creep creep
Pop Pop hope cops don't see me, on a low key
With no regards for the law we dodge em like fuck em all
But I won't get caught up and brought up on charges for none of y'all

Pull me over try to check my slab
Glove compartment gotta get my cash

And been a baller that I am I talk to them,
Giving a damn bout not feeling my attitude
When they realize I ain't even ridin' dirty
Bet you'll be leavin with an even madder mood

You can't arrest me plus you can't sue
This a message to the laws tellin' them WE HATE YOU
I can't be touched or tell 'em that they shoulda known

Trust me it's bad for ya (yeah), kinda like red meat (meat)
Playin with me homie, I promise you'll get beat (beat)
I'm on my grind, the album out next week (week)
They gonna be silent, like me when the Feds speak
Gotta punish 'em dozen, I got a ton of 'em
Lovin in, not in love with 'em, really not here to cuddle hun
But I'll come, I'm just back and they say I'm troublesome
But I'm way more than some trouble, I'm double son
If his name's Terminator, I'm other one (other one)
He got one, just assume who got the other gun
Bring it to life, resurrectin the dead
Not buyin, stop cryin, make a record instead
I swear that y'all rappers really hurtin my head
But my paper don't stop and you ain't hurtin my bread
I ain't worried about a snitch ever alertin the Feds
Take it to the old school go and learn it like Red (haha)
Take it to the Pro Tools if you heard somethin I said
That you think you can do better but prepare to be bled
The grinders on the east, be respectin the C
They be like what up Kid? Like the name was Capri
You know the sayin, the sayin is you get what you see
They see that I'm paid but they can't use they vision on me (haha)
So bein broke is what a hater is accustomed to be
Boys reachin like the pager that's stuck under the seat
Yeah, but you could miss me with that thirty versus another coast
At dinner with Nas and Kelis, like here's another toast

Keep it trill and gettin paid is what I love the most

Up in NY, boys like your frozen son (what you tell 'em man)
And I'm the chosen one
And that's not to mention all the flows I've done
And don't let me get to talkin 'bout the hoes I've run
through, who you supposed to be
I'm right back on top, where I'm 'posed to be
Them ho niggaz left me hangin like a poster be

Dirty south went nationwide 'cause of DJ Screw, I said
""Is that true""?, the god said, yeah it's true I get
to do flows, and wreck show 'cause of DJ Screw I'm fed
But don't be mislead, you the reason we get bread
Please tell him when I get to heaven, it's gon' be respect
He the reason we get checks, ain't gotta be in debt
Ya music helped alot of southern families to get fed
They won't say what I just said (why?), 'cause some of these guys scared (oh)
Just tryin' to acknowledge and put it in these guys heads
I see, I said, ""then deed"", god said
That he glad that the north and southside E.O.E X'd it
I agree, I said, R.I.P., I said
Rest In Peace to the legend Screw and P.A.T. I said
Swear I still jam ya music, I won't let no one abuse it
Can't do it, another's foolish if he think that he the truest
'cause you was the first to screw it, you rule it but I'ma student
I'm new at the stuff ya started, but I'll do it until I'm through it
Life after I loose it, go have a talk with the streets
And they gon' tell ya that I respected the game, Rest In Peace

You ain't finna do nothing, you ain't finna do nothing

Introducing to you now is the kid they love to hate
But when you saying what you saying
You just say it to my face
Yeah you see him? (Yeah)
You see him bow beat him down lean him down (lean him)
Your breathing sound like you now layin down sleepin
You be surrounded or found on the ground beaten
You see him how he look now and he ain't found a reason
My reason is that they won't have to persuade
Me to have the courage to walk right up and say it to your face
A faker never know he fake
A hater never admit he hate
By the time they figure it out is probably gon be too late (yeah)
Grinning up your face is like you tryin' to let me know
That you ain't really happy how how I'm getting all this dough
Let the truth be told tell me is your friend a foe
Better make it clear or get mistaken for a hoe (Yeah)
And then you take him to the floor
I can't ignore it if you're talking
But I hope that what you talking ain't about running up or robbing
Walk around like everybody is the enemy just for precaution (just for precaution)
I get no surprised and have to see an early coffin

And what you smokin'. your brain clouded yet the pine got your mind polluted
You got some smarts in your mind hey it's time use it

Them niggas's lying plus them concept is gettin' included
How could they tell you, you was built to last
You built like a boxing bag, put a whoopin' on that ass
See us approachin' that set in motion in that hour glass
Wrong words are built too fast, find your exit and dash
Lookin for crabs in a bucket tryin' criticize me (me)
But they do it around them niggas don't say it around me (me)
And if they do us opposite how they feel about me (me)
Turn my back and they relax and talk that lip behind me
I see you a busta and I'mma bust ya in your lip
Put some lipstick in my fist, throwin you a kiss
Since I see that you a sucker, suck a gasoline dick
Put it right up to your lip, put a lighter to the tip (boom!)

Where you from? (Where you from?)
Act like you know I'm from the south
We ain't playin', what you sayin'?
I can't hear you when you talk
What you want? (What you want?)

Your mouth runnin' ahead of you, your mouth do what your legs should do
Let me walk to the edge with you, jump off of it, it
It sounds like your ready to, cause these rappers are terrible
And the game is unbearable but I'ma fix, fix
This feeling that's dead in you got your brains like a vegetable

You do have a right to be, you seem like your nice to me
And like your gonna buy me another drink, yeah would you like a seat?)
I tell the boy the same hennessey on ice for me
Her drink starts emptying as she's pouring out her life to me
Telling me about her goals and how successful she would like to be
And invite me to a session of her life and she
Seems so damn innocent but something isn't right to me
She pulls out her picture phone ""I got pictures, would you like to see?""
I'm thinking she gotta be friendly as hell
Giving a soul to me, it's like an identity sell
We never met is the story that my memory tells
Telling me tales like she doesn't handle hennessey well
Getting into it, getting intimate and into details
See, I just met you and you showing me your kids
""Who said I had any kids? I didn't bring up no kids""
Then who's in this picture, ""Man, let you show you just who it is""
[Chorus]
Umm, I don't remember her name but she look like an angel
She wasn't from here, I knew she didn't hang a
Round a part of the hood but hey the story gets stranger
Cause this stranger was stranger than I could explain you see
She said she wasn't married but the rings on her finger
Told me she was langin and using the same uhh
Game I use on women so I couldn't even blame her
Spitting the game I spit to 'em when I'm trying to bang her
(I bump into this dime, he told me that he used to know you
He told me about the loyalty and love he used to show you
He said what he said with a passion like it was so true
Wouldn't take advantage of the fact that the listeners didn't really know you)
There's pictures in my pocketbook, almost got it, I'll show you
She digs in her purse and while she fumbles around
I find that photo, I'm like ""Oh no there's some trouble in town""
I turn around as these two officers is coming in now
They walk in real suspicious and come and sit down
So close, I can see they barrels of the guns to the ground
So close that they can listen to either of us now
We turn back around and she says no need for whispering
Then she tells me that (I don't really give a damn whose listening
Try to make it last a long time was my mission
And he kept on tripping and then I got pissed at him
Hit 'em with my fist and my punches were never missing him)
[Chorus]
Okay, let's get this straight, your man cheated on you and now
You talking to a perfect stranger like it's making you proud
And the rest of this conversation she just telling me how
It wasn't her boyfriend in the pic but a familiar smile
She said (pictures can be deceiving like she knew he was foul
Look closer, you'll see a coward who uses a smile's power
Fleeing the smoke strength, couldn't stand it another hour
So she did what she did then she went to go take a shower)
Damn what do you mean? ( couldn't tell you that I missin him)
I don't understand what your saying, how did you get rid of him?
She dissing him, as I ask her what it is she did to him
She stops, Ay keep talkin I'm listening
(I don't wanna tell about the images I'm picturing)
Henny spilling then she tell me (For real and
I got the feeling of what I'm feeling is that I wanted to kill him)
Something's wrong here and I know just who is the villian
The poison's getting louder, the moral is getting clearer
The officers is looking at us and I can tell they can hear her
Told me (It was protection, Reached for it in the stash)
The plastic is what she grabbed and she put it right on his ass
Bust it before the blast, she thought she was free at least
Baby I think you crazy, Sorry I'm pressing for time
I gotta go grind, time's putting to resting
Now I'm sweating and stressing, this girl's got me guessing
That this conversation is two types of evil confession
And she pulls a clearer picture, It's my damn ex-best friend
How you know him? She told me she was with him at his house
Watching movies on Sundays when they be chilling
And that's exactly the day that the hospital came to get him
The feeling was the worst feeling that she could possibly be feeling
Stood up and then I yelled out ""Why in the hell did you kill him?""
I didn't kill him, I have AIDS, he had sex with 'em and that's crazy"
outro,2005,chamillionaire,Hip-Hop,"They said no when I told them that I'd find a way to get to the top
They didn't know that eventually I'd be the one to worry about
When someone would mention me, they always tried to say I would flop
But this the sound of revenge
Yea
On the path to find out who's true
The only person you can really trust is you
And if you feel like you can't even trust you
Then you can always trust you know who
And if you don't know who you know who is
Then I feel so sorry for you
Cause that's really the only person that can judge you
Critics, people that wanna see you fail will tell you what you can't do
Shouldn't do and must do
But when you got that glow
Nobody else's words can really budge you
Revenge has always been looked upon as a sin
And sometimes you feel like you had to sin to win
Sometime it sound like :gunshot:
Is what it coulda been
When you get to the gates of Heaven they probably wouldn't let ya in
But ya change that meanin' up and success is what it is in the end
And instead of worryin' about what shoulda, coulda, woulda been
Ya turn your head toward the future and keep it movin'
Know what I'm sayin'?
Well say it again
Keep it movin'
Know what I'm sayin'?
Screw it then
Know what I'm sayin?
If you're waitin' for me to fail, your time is runnin' out on that clock
I'm runnin' to the finish yea, when I get there I ain't gonna stop
Success is what I couldn't have, but now I tell em look what I got
It's the sound of revenge"

How you pay to get in the club, and then hate on the pressure y'all pay to see
Now we got mob block live again
Look at these whips we're riding in
Making ball and look easy baby, we don't practice like...
Sliding in I'm never super post when
I'm getting closer I'm just... the face
All the sinners star calling God,
All the rappers start calling Mace,
Drop sounding like an earthquake,
Trunk bound to make an earth shake
Every day is a movie for me, you like the destination on the first day
Telling me it's a birthday, new shoes and her persuade,
You should go appreciate the quire, I ain't the one you persuade,
She ain't worried of the hotel, I wouldn't even get to motel,
Mess around and take your girl from you then sell it to for the...
Oh... have her back, wont' love but I love the stacks
So I'm pulling up and then you know what
They looking at me like what is that

Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up
Hold up, hold up, hold up,
That's what they've been calling me,
Soon they see me roll up, roll up
Don't know what to call that
So they call, they call, they call it
Hold up, hold up, hold up,
That's what they call it.
Hold up, hold up, hold up,

Told Brad to send me a track,
He send me a track to sound like a trap,
I don't know normally do this,
But hey when I do it sound like the trap,
Competition left me in flat, I'm just hoping that you trap,
I'm just hoping you try to try me,
Get drag around by your suit tie,
You can catch me in the forn city,
They don't even know I rap,
First album when platinum so they ain't many places on my map,
Going golf in Iraq, going shopping in Dubai
She'll be asking the man forgives and gives me the gift form Dubai
Bottle water with a mouse trap, no rat can get to my cheese
Her... get no scraps get no bad like her ratches
Wanna book me for five G's,
Read the sign and say stop please,
Can't knock me, my trunk knocking,
My making woman looking knock me,
Call me but I'm unreachable, too trill to be speaker too
God loss in my own garage and they couldn't find me for a week or two,
My trunk are open like pickable,
Me I'm... to be sipping through,
Came to blue, all my speakers blue, but I turn em up and my speakers do.
[Chorus]
Hold up man, just hold up man,
Rap to state then pour down,
Chew up cheese then throw up grants,
Then guess some bread you know I'm jam,
It's lunch time, she got one friend, but just one fine,
One four, one dime, you already know which one is mine,
Tripping like Jessy Jay, see love and got me in the... day
If it comes between hoes and dough I drop off chick and then scoop you pay,
Might as well, I might as well, passing up dough is a major feel,
Take the trip to South Africa, but can't lead the the paper like... pill,
Realest rapper you have ever meet, she want n autograph on her fake breast,
Too young is just too dumb, girl slow it down and take a break twist,
Check it out when my lack is out,
Don't worry bout it, I ain't stressed,
Hot chocolate on my hallo tips they might mess around and get a taste test.

Mixtape Messiah, completed, history get repeated
What up Cham? It's Universal, where's your album? We need it
Like ""Ridin Dirty,"" can you beat it? *er*, message deleted
Gettin throwed off in the crowd, make it look like a brawl (brawl)
If anything get throwed into yours, it look like a towel (towel)
Keep that look right off your face, because it look like a scowl
These suckers think that I'ma sucker, eeeah, ain't one of y'all
My fanbase is a cult, they doin everything that I tell 'em
Appreciate me, keepin it real and purchase everything that I sell 'em
Couldn't get down with that slavery so at labels I wasn't gellin
Now I can ball like Tevin, on the Northside of Levin Reverend
Hallelujah, I made a considerable amount of moolah
So I boota, the world I'ma dangerous as the shooter
Hallelujah, they love how I lyrically send hollows through ya
Not a ruger, but I do got the flow that be goin BOOYAH!
I ain't never really been trippin about it, if you got your posse
Cause I got some partners with me that will pop off like paparazzi
Don't try to see me and show me some love, tellin me that you got me
Takin over's my new hobby and you ain't 'bout to stop me
I let a woman show up late (late), ain't really no need to clock her
They say that time is money, if she's late then it will cost her
I let a woman off her leash (leash), ain't really no need to watch her
They act right, like a Oscar is something I got to offer
Hey, so get your act on just like Kevin Costner
And I continue to be the Mixtape Mi-Mi-Mivasa
They say that talk is cheap, so don't come to me bein a talker
50K is what conversation with me will cost ya

Carrots in my mouth, rocks round as a cucumber

When they, acheww! excuse me, I had to sneeze
'cause after the breeze is my allergies

Totin' a toast up in the butter that I'm posted in
I'ma plastic surgeon, I'm changin' myself a skin
When the beef is open, all you see is a cobra trim
I take that back, all you see is a gold grin
Big grown men in my mouth when it's frozen
When I ride slab I let the U.S. know
They mistake the foreign for a U.F.O
I never seen that before, my lac is low
Neons on the back 'll glow, that's fa'sho
They call my 4-do the Oprah show
Look in the seats man it's mostly hoes
Squatin' low on 4's, mostly vogues
I'ma slow poke, with spokes and bo's
When I come down, trunk open close
Woman on my hood, posin' dough
Do-bands on my door just to hold the fold
I'ma hog lanes like I stole the road

This is for my gangstas, real niggas, ballas, trill niggas
East side, West side, chunk ya deuce up
Plenty niggas get they head turned red for da bread
Start off with da information, load it up in ya head
Couldnt hold it, so it turned out its somethin' he said
Wut he tell da FEDS (he need someone to call)
Your decision was to snitchin' and they was there to listen
When he told what he know, said they barely was trippin'
Less time, now da niggas in a better position
Unless you count the fact that the streets know he was snitchin'
He was lookin' at a 30 but he only did 10,
How your years turn to months, can he tell you dat, and
He ain't really gotta answer, just the sweat in his hands
Will he make it out to make it, mm well it depends
Everybody know the info you was tellin ya friends
Plus the streets know the deals that you made with the pen
Russian Roulette, yep nigga bet the barrel will spin
You hear that, yea nigga that's the sound of revenge
Walk down the right road, 'cause the streets is so cold
You betta take ya life slow or you'll miss it
Listen to da G-Code, if you know what I know,
Then you'll keep yo mouth closed (keep you're mouth closed nigga)

If you goin' live that crime life, I hope you hold dat 9 tight
You live life like a pussy then dats prolly what you die like
I neva' eva' loved a sucka, them ain't really my type
Rat snakes, yea mayne the game is full of wild-life
Don't wanna do no time right?
You wanna live that high life
Like go withdrawal, have a hundred thousand in ya eye sight
Enter ya crib, see the clouds peepin through ya skylight
You be a copycat, (cat), 'cause mine right
That's what he told me but I didn't listen
Doin' crime for a dime wasn't my intention
You insane, think his name sumin' I will mention
Only snitches need someone to tell
Alotta niggas in the game, hustlin' doin' they thing
Usin' codes on the phone with they usual slang
If you know what he know then you won't say a thing
You wouldn't need someone to tell
Careful bout the life you lead, ain't smart with ya life,
You plead, the streets will ignite ya T, like you ain't got the right to breathe
To choke on da realness, reality is what the fake don't know how to deal with
Words leak from the teeth, but he'll say seal it
Then go get a undercover brother he can chill with
Find a nigga that be hustlin to make a deal with
But the streets will hold court for him and'll deal with it
Walk down the right road, 'cause the streets is so cold
You betta' take ya life slow or you'll miss it
Listen to da G-Code, if you know what I know,
Then you'll keep yo mouth closed (keep you're mouth closed nigga)

This for the G's, street jugglin', move da fire
When you talkin what you talkin' it ain't through the wire
Police pull you over, now they callin' you a liar
You got amnesia, don't even know the dude beside ya
You don't know, you ain't sayin', you ain't heard what he said
Told you a closed mouth ain't gon neva' get fed
A open mouth'll get you county instead of the F-E-D-S
Some scared niggas speak up so they'll be less in the red
Niggas can't deal with no 95 so they day-to-day budgeters
Its the hustlers that get put away by the customers
You upstate, niggas use to be southerners
Here the streets make the laws and don't answer the governors
We the niggas that's too real to snitch on a snitch
But make a snitch turn to puff with a flick of the wrist
That ain't goin' get in arguments, just go get you a clip
And they goin' think about the consequences, let em repent
Walk down the right road, 'cause the streets is so cold
You betta take ya life slow or you'll miss it
Listen to da G-Code, if you know what I know,
Then you'll keep yo mouth closed (keep you're mouth closed nigga)

I put two shots and fill yall, and I yell out failing is impossible
Telling me what they finna do, gonna do, what they gots to do
Live from the G-5, that noise that you hear on top of you
Top of you like the cops will do, ...when you resist arrest
I ain't tired, so I don't sleep, I just resist arrest
Pop the CD inside your deck and just resist arrest
Cuz another is just another nigga, this is the best
And I don't two-step partner, 10 vehicles dirty dancing
Let me know when I'm major pain, soon as I step off the Phantom
Thinking it's Flavor Flav when they look at the mansion
Ain't got to be cute, I got loot, so they accept me as handsome
And I'm close to the edge, I'm near the cliff like a hugstable
Just like Cliff Hugstable, you'll need a doctor adjusting you
pull the floor off from under you, like the ish was adjustable
And I hope that you falsifiers can afford a deductible
And I couldn't tell yall nothing but other rappers and their deals
but I got that fire, they false alarming with day-drills
[Chorus]
I just got paid and holla at Johnny
Got a brand new chain, with the block stunning
On the fresh set of swangs, making that money
And I'm sitting sideways, sideways, sideways
With my trunk going boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
You hear my trunk going boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
(Ultimate Victory....March 27)
You here my trunk going"

This is the the sound of,
This is the the sound of revenge.
You in the presence of the finest (the finest)
Chamilitaryman.
This for the streets (for the streets).
Lets give em' something they can mmm...
In the Trunk.
At this point you should be turnin' your speakers up (turn your speaker up), Chamillionaire man.
Its a southern thang mmmmmmmm, (haha Chamilitaryman) trunk.
I heard somebody say that the south ain't got no Lyricist, well bang bang at the game like Everyone down here is pissed.
You lookin' for the truth, then look not further here it is.
Turn it up a notch so they can not say they not hearin' this.
They say Chamill sick, click click here's a clip.
Bang bang at the rap game to make your spirits lift.
And it seems to me that the industry is all on Jigga's dick.
Who? You, you, and you nigga, pick a click.
Universal sent me to bring some realness to the industry.
Got here then I realised that ain't nobody real but me (me).
OK a couple niggas but none of em' real as me.
Tell your favorite rapper to diss me if he disagree (gree).
I'm bad I'm actin like your favorite rapper isn't me.
Tell your second favorite who's the best, and show him a picture of me.
He'd have to take me out to prove that he's as sick as me.
So me verse me the only battle that y'all going to get to see (haha).
I'm playin' sayin' what I'm sayin'to make these haters mad.
Prepitratin' hatin' ass see me ridin' candy slabs.
Disbelieve his ass, how many vehicles can he have?
I be losin' count myself, and I ain't even that bad at math (math).
That's how we do it in Texas, poppin' trun and grippin' wood (wood).
We reply to threats how?
Nigga I wish you would.
If you keep on talkin' (talkin'), but that's if you could.
Gotta trun' my speakers up, can you hear em' now?
No, Good!
[Chorus]
Ain't runnin' from a thang,
'Cuz I ain't never been a punk, drama in the thang,
'Cuz I can bring it if they want, I'ma let it bang,
So they can feel it in the mmm in the trunk.
Your body wit ya' gang, decide your rep and throw it up, what you tryin' to drank?
'Cuz I'm about to get ya' drunk,
I keep it pimpin' man,
So they can feel it in the mmm (chamilitaryman) in the trunk.
This for the street niggas knowing they gotta pee in a cup.
Know your P-Officer tossin' ya' when he see the result.
This for the G's (G's), haters what you see in the scope.
Gague gunna get sprayed, likes its sprayed when you see them approach.
Tell you ahead of time, solo i can handle mine.
You ain't to smart but play the part like you a panamime (boy).
But you don't have a nine (nine), I'll show you a hammer mine,
The kind that'll make you do the runnin' man like it's hammer time.
Shout out to the west, and all my gangstas kackied up.
Actin' up, and packin' up, Heat that make you back it up.
The hoes back it up soon as they hear the back of the trunk.
Now my stock like New York slang,
What you mean? That's what's up.
Money, stack it up when they feel they have enough.
Get the chips and add em' up, then she givin' that to us (us).
Don't put all that in cuffs, treat your money like a slut.
Niggas better share, hell yea, 'cuz i just wanna cut.
A hata gettin' cut someone goin get hurt (hurt),
Specially if you met me and was disrespectin' turf (turf).
(If it's Texas)I'm the worse (worse), ice lookin' like sherbet,
Bouncin' off my chest, you starin' at it like a pervert.
Mix tape god (god), don't me go to church first (why?).
Might as well since all the rappers wearin' church shirts.
Better think ahead a time, call yourself a nurse.
Diss me in your second, and wont get to finish your third verse.
[Chorus]
Aint' runnin' from a thang,
Cuz I aint' never been a punk, drama in the thang,
Cuz I can bring it if they want, I'ma let it bang,
So they can feel it in the mmm in the trunk.
Your body wit ya' gang, decide your rep and throw it up, what you tryin' to drank?
Cuz I'm about to get ya' drunk,
I keep it pimpin' man,
So they can feel it in the mmm (you in the presence of the finest) trunk.
The game is full of fakers, all these rappin' niggas front (front).
Controversy sells, the industry givin' em' what they want (want).
See he ain't gangsta as he say, that's why they dress em' up.
Get a vest, a plastic gun and go pull a publicity stunt (stunt).
Ho act like she slow, don't know dat I'm rich.
Can't ignore the handle missin' from the doors on my whip.
But then she saw me on TV and told me pause for a flick.
What you tell her?
You can 106 and park on my dick!(on my dick).
Can't speak about Texas and not mention men (me).
The world goin' to have to see the truth come out eventually (ly).
I wreck any gimmick rapper out from A to Z.
934-829 to the two if you still disagree (gree).
We never marry a ho (no), what im a marry em' fo.
I'm to busy tearin' up my shows and gettin' married to dough (dough).
Grave digga nigga, what you mean?
I burry your flow, run go get ya' city come back, then I'm goin to burry your area code.
[Chorus]
Aint' runnin' from a thang,
'Cause I ain't never been a punk, drama in the thang,
'Cause I can bring it if they want, I'ma let it bang,
So they can feel it in the mmm in the trunk.
Your body wit ya' gang, decide your rep and throw it up, what you tryin' to drank?
'Cause I'm about to get ya' drunk,
I keep it pimpin' man,
So they can feel it in the mmm in the trunk."

grown-and-sexy,2005,chamillionaire,Hip-Hop,"Ha-ha yeah, it's yours truly Houston's own
Chamillionaire holding it down, for the playa that don't believe
In love at first sight, but the playa that believes that he
Can get love on the first night, that's right
So before I get to discussing, what type of eye candy I need
What type of visual stimulation, she needs to be able to achieve
There's something special bout ya, that ain't hard to see
Grown and sexy from your head, down to your toes you know you're fine
Got that perfect face a perfect shape, and perfect smile (a perfect smile)
But soon as you turned around, it's something that I realized yeah
You look better from behind, you look better from behind, grown and sexy
From the moment you flashed your teeth, I knew that we had to meet
Your face was the Mona Lisa, your ass was a masterpiece
Asked ya if you was married, and that's when you answered no
I asked if you had a nigga, and that's when you said fa sho
So I didn't care, as you walked away I was stare
At your bottom in apple bottoms, your waist was shaped like a pare
Really round at the bottom, a little thin up there
So instead of letting ya leave, I pursued ya just like the playa
That I am and damn, couldn't help but to help myself
To a helping because I smelled some perfume, that can make me melt
And you shoulda seen my demeanor, I had to control myself
Approaching you from the rear, as I tapped you right on your belt
And you tried to look surprised, like you didn't know I was behind ya
But I could tell by your smile, you was waiting on me to find ya
Mess with my thought a bit, and tried to play hard to get
You don't wanna look like you're freaky, pretend like it's hard to hit
Let's give a toast, to the ladies that look better up close
That look better by the behind, and better when you approach
You try your best to get up close, until you smelling the soap
Lovely ladies from coast to coast, get in bed and she dope
Not a eight and not a nine, grade you more than just a dime
Bentley steering wheel body, cause you look better from behind
Grip around your waist turn it, like I'm just trying to get a better view
Cause God must of been working hard, when he assembled you
I'm trying to test drive, your rear and your shape
And I'm power steering your waist, and I see your rear is in shake
If you thought I couldn't handle it, then you're really mistaken
No one here to keep you near, then you're here for the taking
I'm still waiting, for you to give me one good reason
Why you couldn't leave and be speeding, off in some good breezing
You'll never spend another boring night, in some hood freezing
But posted up by standing water, during some good season"

They all happy about the records I sold
Now I'm back for the victory, 'bout to get on the road
They say I gotta sell records, but I ain't sellin my soul
I won't sell it for platinum and I won't sell it for gold
The game full of suckers, I know that they gotta go
Now the Chamillinator's the general in control
So when I tell you I run it, it's because I run it
And you should run from it, you know you don't want it
[Verse 1 - Chamillionaire]
Yeah, rappers be talkin too much, just like they rap for the Feds
I got a lot of little crumbsnatchers that's after me bread
Notice that I said after, cause that is back where I left
March 27, I'm droppin, that means you have to be scared
Yeah I'm cookin up somethin, in rap I'm Dennis the Menace
I put a G periodically on the table like a chemist
My homie keep that metal right in your mouth like a dentist
The hateration is shrinkin like the amount of your minutes
on your Sidekick Motorola, your Nextel phone
They wanna know what's the business, I'ma let my neck tell homes
I drop the budget on what you might think my neck sells loans
So far you can't reach me like when your Nextel roams
Like a tunnel in Amsterdam, Cham he got a dope flow
Your flow kinda SoCo, Chamillitary's the logo
The lizard will visit, so disrespect is a no no
Cause you know the fo fo will (brrp) stick 'em like pogo
Pogo stick, the homoness in the industry
Got me a little shaky about every rapper that isn't me
Ask anybody out there who think that he lyrically
Killin me and he droppin quicker than a Reggie Miller 3
Step in the label and I tell 'em give me my green
Then I send in Famous and make 'em give to my team
I got that money and power kinda like Jimmy Iovine
A little more money than power so they call me ""Jimmy High Cream""
Or maybe Jimmy Hakeem, they respectin me, why?
Cause my sales are above, ain't even next to the sky
I know a few backstabbers, but I'm not expectin to die
Cause I keep my eyes open like I'm expectin a knife
I run it in the underground, so y'all step to the side
It's like lightning the minute my wrist and necklace collide
Magazines sneak this in, tryna mess up my Vibe
Now 1.3 million fans will accept your reply
Cause I run it

Movin' target went across the street and unfortunately the car didn't miss him,
And now the family is soon to know, that they gone have to do another funeral,
The angels ain't singing to your tune no more, don't move too fast, baby, move it slow...
Cuz one day in here, baby... Next thing you know,
Next thing you know, everything you used to move don't move no mo'!
[Hook: Akon (Chamillionaire)]
I see them watching, they waiting,
For an oppurtunity to ride up on me,
Hopin' they don't roll up on me, cuz today I'm ridin' dirty,
And if they stop me I might be going to jail tonight!
I see them watching, and waiting,
For an oppurtunity to ride up on me, (This is not a movie, it's real life!)
Hopin' they don't roll up on me, cuz today I'm ridin' dirty,
And if they stop me I might be going to jail tonight!

It's real life... It ain't just a song, it's a message....
Nobody ever opens their eyes 'till someone gets killed...

""F"" what you heard me,
See me in person
You know I'm fly
You know I'm fly
You know I'm fly
Even your girlfriends and all her girlfriends
You know I'm fly

You know I'm fly
I keep it dirty, dirty you heard me
You know I'm fly
You know I'm fly
You know I'm fly as the sky
Fly like a birdy (what?)
Fly like a birdy
Fly like a
Yellow band, excuse me Cham, please give me the time again
Diamonds so large, the minute hand ain't got no time for them
Damn! How you supposed to see the time when them
M & M-sized diamonds lay right beside the hand
Chamilll, Rasaq, and Lil Wayne make a nigga feel ashamed
Trying to hide the bling in the middle of your little chain
In the drain, down it go, say they love the sound of those
Chamilltary boys, we the illest boys around here hoe
Flier than a bird yes but your correct if your guess
Is that the eagle gonna hurt when aiming at your bird chest
Pow! Forget your feelings, I could care less
Leave you where I leave you, you can see ya in the turbulence
Girl do yourself a favor and don't say I have to pay ya
Give a favor to a playa and just pass it to my neighbor
And when your finished could you tell your friend to flavor
Cause the king ain't gonna savor, just gonna save that ass for later
[Chorus]
Mayne I'm fly as a plane, me and Lil Wayne
Spitting game, leave a girl Weezy like his name
We don't have to say a thing cause the chain can explain
First they look at the piece then they look at the rang
I'm fly as a pelican, ice on my skeleton
On a Sunday morning, I stay sharper than a reverend
Candy on my doors, looking something like gelatin
Syrup in my cup but I ain't talking about medicine
I'm cold as an Eskimo, throwed from my head to toe
The white tee fresh but it starts in my denims though
Yeah and if I pull down my fly, I could piss on the sky
Cause nigga I'm that high
I pulled up in heaven up in the candy painted ride
And I gave Jesus five and I'm still alive
Even though I know them haters wish I would die
Even in they day dreams, I'm a still stay fly boy
[Chorus]
They call me Birdman Junior, I'm flier than the rest
I'm trying to get a couple cool pigeons to the nest
And if you look at how the jewels glisten on my chest
Then you will be impressed and yes that's V-S
Fly boy to death, I used to only fly
First class on every plane 'til I bought a jet
I'm on the runway, let down the steps
Open the phantom door and light up the cess
I smoke the best, Chamillion come get me
From University of Houston after I pass my test
Swisha laced wit' syrup, it'll come your nerves
So boy I'm so high, I could palm the world
Yeah and I'm strapped for the turbulence
Pow! Now you up here with me in a cloud (Chea)
They call me Weezy Baby, the son of a stunner
Bitch I'm flyer than a motherfucker, ya know
[Chorus]
Poster child to the pop trunk, I pop it up and let it bang
I'm show ya how to rep the city, correctly run the game
Grip tightly on the grain, turn it left and we call it swang
Let me show ya how to make the baddest ladies scream your name
I'll put that boy ""J"" Junior in the future in a body bag
I'm trying to poke that bad body like a boxing bag
Trying to get below the belt and beat it like a boxing jab
Hit it then I quit it like I dropped out of a boxing class
Know how we doing it, we been chopped and screwing it
Coming to get that number one spot you got like Ludacris
Know he acting groupie-ish taking a sip out Luda's Cris
We buy our own bottles, grab one and put it to your lips
Hating on your hood, throw your hood up, put it in his face
Reppin' Texas, got that real estate down in that realest state
Didn't need a bigger place, didn't need a bigger face
On my watch but forgot and went a got them both a place
Fix ya face"

Gotta couple friends I'll recommend
Get cash niggas better hit the pen'

I'm the rapper they waiting for, you the rapper they tired of
How the hell you say you blew up so quick and then rub it in
When you ain't seen a royalty check and know nothing 'bout publishing
I feel sorry for the thirteen year old teenagers, who loving him
They try to tangle with the sharks but I'm sorry, he doesn't swim
I'ma rip off another limb, no need for partici-hating
I suggest that you get to shaking the spot and just switch locations
I wouldn't stop if he told me, if him and Clark Kent was dating
'Cause he couldn't spit hotter than me that pussy was kissing Satan
I know the public is waiting for Controversy to sail

He blew up quick and nobody was there to save him
Keep it cool I tried to but you know I'm a rider

Get respect of the streets, you get respected to tollers

I'm the rapper they waiting for, you the rapper they tired of

At WKTB work your booty, Pimp radio station, um
There seems to be an excessive amount of fraud artists out here
And we have a couple of artists here that feel the same way
Uh, let me hear what you have to say here sir
Let me silence all the talk, can't match up with my vault
You ain't getting no respect from real G's on the North
You get put in duct tape, you cupcake you too soft
Ain't no rapper got broke off this hard since Tha Boss
I've seen your chain but I how much it cost
You can't be like E.S.G. and let your body defrost

Come around hurry and you gon' get beat down

Ay man, you know what? Life is real crazy man
It's crazy how life is like a full circle
You know, back in the day, I used to look at my life
I used to just think into the future
And think that I was going to be a basketball player, NBA player
I used to wake up every morning, go out play basketball everyday
Told myself I was going to go to the NBA, nobody was going to stop me
Wasn't a realistic dream, I ended up changing, I ended up being a rapper
Who would of thought? Over a 1 million records later I realise
The best basketball player, the smartest person in class
The baddest broad in the whole entire school
Everybody that used to be capping on you, ain't got the ammunition to brag no more
So as you stand in the presence of me and the present
I can actually look back in the past
Think about all them little African jokes and laugh
Hahaha, where ya cash?
Don't try to be mad at me, I'm just trying to eat
No, really I'm trying to eat, like I pull up to the window
MacDonald's drive-through, you know what I'm talking bout
I'm asking for the number 4, Supersize
And guess who I see, *Who you see?*
Somebody who used to talk bad bout me
See, you don't even want to show no gratitude
You want to pass me my food with a attitude
Like ""Here, have it dude!""
I'm like, ""Maaan, can I get some napkins fool?""
Now that's cool, that's cool, that's cool
Then I hand you a twenty, and as I tell you to keep the change
When I drive off the BALLING license plates must ironically make you feel strange
But you ain't got to hold your head down in shame
You just got to get out there and get on top of your game
You know what I'm talking about man?

You can't get next, I came to plex
So call up Dike Jones and tell him he just got wrecked"
i-tip-down,2005,chamillionaire,Hip-Hop,"I tip down, grippin' on pine
Sour apple caddie wine berry overline
Paint on shine, reclined on swine
Slab in slow-mo, but my rims on rewind
The block won't mind, trunk blow from behind
Open up the fist see the glow and design, man
So throw'd you can hate em', rose gold in the rotation
Shoulder blade and dislocation when I'm swangin' bones is achin'
Boys wanna hate me but I don't borrow
Prolly 'cuz my diamonds shinin' on they darling
24's crawlin', ya boy is ballin'
Fifth wheel wiggle like the fin on a dolphin
Sittin' on diss but the words out my lips
I go hard in the paint, I can make the beat skip
I go fed off the head, stack my bread
Never scared threaten me get infra-red and I throw lead
I'm that boy mayne, I'm in that toy mayne
Flip-flop paint when I slide watch that toy change
Stay on my grind, stay on the pine
That's why my gold's shine and you blind all the time
I be comin' down, all my girls fine
They call me M&M;'s I got red, yella's and browns, man
I be comin' down, I be tippin' down
You can tell I'm tippin' down
Rims spinnin' in rewind
Top is up I let it down
From that H-Town to yo town, we tippin' down
You can tell I'm tippin' down
How my trunk is showin' surround
Ask them how they like me now
From that H-Town to yo town, we tippin' down
I tip down, bangin' underground
Clear coats on shine
Prisma drippin' off like slime
I tip down, at action number 9
Tell the diamonds drip down
From my spine to the ground
When are you gon' sign
Stop worryin' 'bout mine
Put ya mouth to use and give my spinners a spit-shine
If y'all don't mind, please don't talk down
Put the 9 to your mind and blow ya mind outta ya mind, man
Niggaz gon' hate but they can't wait
Some claimin' they real really they fake
And ride in the slab spent a day shakin'
Speakers keep breakin' the Playstation
It's Akeem, also known as the King
Zeem-Zeem sour beam my screens pop up on the scene
Well, what are you watchin'?, Tell the truth it don't matter
Shout out to J-Mack, Mella Mac and the Mad Hatter
Spreewell's standin' on the ladder
Squash the cheddar ain't on my level
The plex can't get settled
Pop the trunk and I get metal
You can leave Jamaica
Make a run move and I break ya
One-Two, breaker, breaker
My plane fleein' to Jamaica
Break ya neck I'ma day shaker
No luck I play with skills
After playin' skills after the game I'm payin' bills
Midwest say I'm real, the South say I'm trill
Step out the Cheville still holdin' my woodwheel
Stop at IHOP ain't never gon' pay the bill
Carrots in my mouth I'm already havin' a good meal
Northside fa' real, man, hold up man
Ro, Twin where y'all at, y'all gotta tip down with me man
You can tell I'm tippin' down

It's that six six long dick slim nigga sticking your chick
Pulling tricks looking slick at all times when I'm flipping
Bar sipping car dipping grand wood grain gripping
Still tippin' on four fours wrapped in four fours
Pimping four hoes and I'm packing four fours
Blowing on the endo Game Cube Nintendo
Five percent tint so you can't see up in my window
These niggaz don't understand me 'cause I'm Boss Hogg on candy
Top down at Maxi's wit a big glock nine handy
Pieced up creased up staying dressed to impress
Big boss belt buckle under my Mitchell and Ness
Oh, Gucci shades up on my braids when I Escalade
When I'm riding Sprewells sliding like a escapade
I got it made the big boss of the north
Ain't shit changed I still represent Swisha House (Ha!)

I'm flipping drop with invisible tops
Hoes bop when my drop step out
I'm shaking the block with four eighteens'
Candy green with eleven screens

My chain light up like a lamp 'cause now I'm back with the camp
I'm crawling similar to a ant 'cause I'm low to the earth
People's feelings get hurt when they figure out what I'm worth
I got eighty fours poking out at the club I'm showing out
I'm a player ain't no doubt hoes want to know what I'm bout
Biggest diamonds off in my mouth princess cuts all in my chain
Wood grain all in my range dripping stains when I switch lanes
Switched the name It's still the same Swisha House or Swisha Blast
Mike Jones he running the game and Magnificent bout his cash
Michael Watts he made me hot hard work took me to the top
G. Dash took me to the lot he wrote a check and bought a drop
I got the internet going nuts

Lookin at my cars and my clothes, black on black's the new thing
""What you lookin at nigga?"" startin to be the new slang
Black on black crime and black on black rhyme, all the same
Realize through seein eyes that we F'in up the game
The originators didn't survive, rappers really your bastards
And the Phantom Rolls Royce is really your caskets
A bunch of babies and ladies, period rappers
The naggin keeps goin and goin with no period after
Hall pass, pass, pass, Screw too it's a shame
Some say the purple syrup was the root of the blame
Some call it a Screw, so people remember the name
The rest sellin tapes screwed, tryna eat off his fame
Now I use half of my mind capacity, smarter people just have to be
Sarcastic critics ain't gettin it, if you laugh at me
I'm from the south, where your mouth will make you a casualty
Criticizin me, but your snap dancin to ""Laffy T""
Yeah, yeah, anywhere on the planet
I seen you all doin that Joc dance dammit
One day I'ma make a classic, if I haven't
Hater is a hateration, the Me-ssiah won't have it
Kill you, they gonna say he was an idiot man
I spit a verse by doin it, the streets give me your praise (haha)
Fans love you in mysterious ways
Major labels callin 'em artists but they really are slaves
Pick a grave, cause every damn one of 'em's like a graveyard
and your just an item on sale like it's Kmart
And the budget you workin with is your pay card
If your budget's low, don't worry, don't even pay for it
Just take it, I hope that you can run quick
I'm a ""Undaground Legend"" like Hump and Lil' Flip
Money is the case, yeah, usually when it's switched
It's Chamillitary mayne, now say it cause it sticks
Even with Paul, I never tried to steal all his glory
Never begged Swishahouse niggaz to make a hit for me
Naw, I ain't tryna copy his story

If you was smart you'd watch the golds that's on top of my crotch
The rocks in my watch, is more then a Rocky Sandlot
You jealous 'cause you bought diamonds from diamond shamrock
Look, all recruiters should be checkin' my stats
I cross competition over shake em' dead in they tracks
I pack an axe by my way, bodyguard by my biscuit
Make money, lose money never afraid to risk it
I don't get writers block, I block other writers
Spittin' fire like if I had a mouth full of lighters
I'm countin' so much money that I caught a hand-cramp
I date models you date girls that went to band camp
I'ma hurricane, you just a gust of wind
I'm on fire, you just ashes and dust my friend

They sick of them boys, pullin' up in ridiculous cars
Ain't no ones, sicker then are's the wizard of oz
Couldn't give you a bigger brain and make you rich as them boys
Young Koopa the weatherman, he lelay his weatherband
With drank in a metal can, want to stop him get a better plan
That one you got, that ain't really workin' pat'na
Ya shirt is prada, how come ya flow ain't worth a dollar, holla
Chamillion's insane niggaz gonna complain
Can't explain why ya girl want to give me brain and run a train
Niggaz runnin' in shame, tellin' them to run in train
The Lizard stepped in the game and started runnin' thangs
If ya can't sleep anymore while the raindrops pour
And you look our your window and hear footsteps on the floor
If you saw a crooked smile and a glistenin' jaw
Don't open the door fa' sure time for bad weather why'all, let it reign

Bad weather's ruin about, if you travel my route
It's time to flood the market, 'cause there's been a drought
Review the resume, my team is undefeatable
You fabricate ya life with stories unbelievable
I'ma ballin' star, you a fallin' star
All used up like no minutes on a callin' card
I'm the bank you ain't nothin' but a dollar or two
You just sand on a beach, and I'm the wave that swallows you
Nobody follows you, your like bad directions
Ya life needs an eraser, there's to many corrections
Ever since I was born, I've been far from the norm
I'm the one that kept ya girl warm when you was gone
Now you and ya born needin' ya palm
Watchin' thorn or outside a dorm, humpin' ya horn ya heart torn
You get warned down the scarecrow and a crop full of corn
Grab an umbrella 'cause them boys bringin' the storm

Banging that Screw it's just me and you, we having sex
This goes out to my ladies in Little Rock, that don't lay on no little cock
That'll rock that little Postropedic, till the springs in the middle pop
Listen to R&B;, but she listen to Screw a lot
Treated cock like a lollipop, she gon taste every little drop
Fly to Thaila, will go live just try to
With tight pants, so she could show off the spine behind her
She fine but finer, is the dime beside her
Lost a friend but Jennady, and ain't trying to find her
You're not minor, so lil' mama I'm gonna name you
Queen Koopa for the night, tonight I'm gonna claim you
Picture your leg lifted, at an acute angle
Hitting all the degrees of your Assossole's triangle
You're my angel, would you mind if I kissed your design
Put my hands on your behind, while I'm dicking you down
Help you reach your climax, hit the switches and clown
Liquids glistening off your spine, water trickling down
Yeah she dries off, after soaking the skin with soap and then motion
In media approaching and lotion her skin with notion then
I'm focusing, hoping to get her soaked again
Hoping to get her wet as the ocean, that men be floating in
I'm coaching and hoping, she'll let the show begin
Hoping she'll let me open, and poke it up in the open and
I'm just joking and, getting all in emotion and
Going in, know this man

Fill up your tank some mo', and give you some drank to po'

Beat up and change the flow, and screw it and bang it slow

After I make you moan, but don't get too comfortable
It ain't no need to be alarmed, shh, baby be calm

I swear when I turn you on, I won't disturb your mom
Fluids flowing through your body, got you burning warm
Go on let me slide inside, I love the way that you ride
Know you feeling the vibe, by the screw music I provide
I turn the tune up, two days before June 29th
A little faster slower, only one way to decide
You damn right, it feel good, let's get this understood
I'ma show you I can control you, while I'm gripping my wood
You don't mess with other ladies, but I wish that you would
'Cause a naked lady would look good, sitting on top of your hood
You don't complain, 'bout all them other chicks I be having
'Cause you be helping me grab 'em, your jewelry made by Davin
And them heffers be babbling, but they don't have what you having
Face down and your ass erect, popped up imagine
How we could switch and do it fast, sometimes we do it slow
When I'm in it you don't complain, 'cause I'm working it like a pro
Mean you tipping on a mission, gotta go snatch that cash
When I get back to the pad, I'ma wax that ass
Rubbing lotion on your frame, the next night we do the same
Got you stripping with your top missing, now you know I'm 'bout to bang
My body and your frame, until tomorrow once again

Niggaz like Rock-A-Bye baby, cockin' .380's on the daily
Yo best bet's on baby, ain't gotta call the hood baby
My heater heavy I feel bout 50 pounds more then I weight see
Fam and the niggaz don't make me
Since you don't make me, can't break me
My crib 250,000, I'm livin' in housin' and payment
I got the surveillance in maintenance, thought you was makin' lil' statements
Showin' yo crib like you ballin' big, I was killin' em' with patience
You pussy niggaz can't face him, they wanna erase him like Jason
But now they shakin' and pacing, like how the hell we gon' face him
I can't believe that you doubted me, while you was talkin' down on me
You ain't realize the people that you was around was all down with me
But I won't say no names, no trace of snitchin' inside of me
But I live by the G-Code, and you don't live by the boundaries, get him"
i-m-da-king,2005,chamillionaire,Hip-Hop,"Mix Tape Messiah
Da king is here, nigga
Ay what these other niggaz talkin', I don't believe that shit
I'm da king 'cuz I said it and I mean that shit
Ay I'm da king 'cuz I said it, I'm da king 'cuz I said it
I'm da king 'cuz I said it and I mean that shit
Ay what these other niggaz talkin', I don't believe that shit
I'm da king 'cuz I said it and I mean that shit
Ay what's so special 'bout him, he ain't all that, shit
I set the city on fire and you seen that shit
Stupid you runnin' around like the Messiah isn't a force
Then tell me how did my first album even get on The Source
I was sittin' next to pimpin' Ken, was he pimpin', of course
But I was thinkin' 'bout gettin' with Trina and tryna pimp me a Porsche
I can't hand a nigga the rap game now 'cuz I'm usin' it
Ain't a underground rapper gon' have it 'til I through with it
I don't burn bridges nah, other rappers'll ruin it
I just jump over the bridge and pimp-slap 'em for doin' it
I'ma embarrass ya so bad, that ya label won't say they know ya
You's a good ass promoter, but the fat lady say it's over
Mixtape Messiah 2 is the bullet I'm savin' for ya
And I can pop trunk pumps on ya coffin' and raise it for ya
And I ain't the only person who sick of ya voice
I kill a rapper with one verse and the real niggaz rejoice
But I was forced do you feel any remorse? Of course
That's why I'ma show up at his funeral and pop trunk on his corpse
Ay what these other niggaz talkin', I don't believe that shit
I'm da king 'cuz I said it and I mean that shit
Ay I'm da king 'cuz I said it, I'm da king 'cuz I said it
I'm da king 'cuz I said it and I mean that shit
Ay what these other niggaz talkin', I don't believe that shit
I'm da king 'cuz I said it and I mean that shit
Ay what's so special 'bout him, he ain't all that, shit
I set the city on fire and you seen that shit
Yeah, you'll never get on my level, no need to go get a ladder
You better run when I come like a pitcher that hit the batter
You paid in full, nah, but I got alot of respect for Hatter
Even though niggaz be ignorin' my questions bout business matters
Cat tell me to call Hatter, Madd Hatter said call Cat
I call niggaz about some business, and I never get a call back
I just wanted my songs back, but they act like I'm on crack
To drop another Cham' and Paul, we ain't even on contract
Parta' the game is that, I keep gettin' reminded daily
Labels ahead 'll screw you, that's the business out of it baby
Nigga was grindin' daily, but suspicions was kinda crazy
I had to pretend like I was broke, just to get paid in full to pay me
It's crazy, for the label with the reputation for actin' a ass
Like Rap-A-Lot, what's the label that was always on time with cash
Gave 'em my price, they didn't try to make me go down a tag
So for J.P., Tom, Rad, and Chief, it's done they ain't gotta ask
Ain't a nigga who can persuay me to go back to House
So I can hear Dike Jones tell me he got platinum in his mouth
That nigga soft, he ain't never move no crack in the South
Was in packagin' soft, and he said he stack more stacks then the Boss
Sure you do, I hope that's not a story they told to you
You need to pimp-slap that sick pup and maker who controllin' you
You ain't runnin' nothin', only you would go vote for you
'Cuz my pockets got more G's, then a G-Unit quotable
G-G-Geez, you's a pee-on please
Why is he here somebody please, tell this pee-on leave
Air-condition on my wrist, I stay with free-on sleeves
Ya stay on D, like defenders durin' three-on-three's
My momma moved out the hood to a 5 bedroom home
Rasaq moved off to solo and got a lil' crib of his own
Then I bought a Ninja bike and another whip on chrome
My money long, I stand on top of the world and spit on Jones
Your album, so what we heard you was comin' soon
Yeah, the song with Alicia Keys, or maybe you said it was Loon
I can fit your crib inside my truck, and I'd still have leg-room
Then I can park that whole truck inside my Master Bedroom
Saw ya DVD you talkin' that ridiculous noise
Sister got kids with baby cribs bigger then yours
Danny DeVito duckin' down couldn't even fit through your doors
You gotta be Kiddin' me boy, is you Kiddin' you sure, sure
Ay what these other niggaz talkin', I don't believe that shit
I'm da king 'cuz I said it and I mean that shit
Ay I'm da king 'cuz I said it, I'm da king 'cuz I said it
I'm da king 'cuz I said it and I mean that shit
Ay what these other niggaz talkin', I don't believe that shit
I'm da king 'cuz I said it and I mean that shit

And make somebody slide

Why, you are still are talking lies
Don't they know I will ride
And make these busters hide

Run the game, game, try to scandalise my name
We run the game, run, we run the game
Run the game, game, try to scandalise my name

Shoulda seen it coming baby
Shoulda seen it coming nigga
Yo, yo
We running the game nigga, I'ma run you out the game nigga
I ain't gonna let no pussy niggas represent my city nigga
Nuh uh, especially not no gimmick pussy niggas
Yeah
[Chamillionaire]
We real niggas, we ride chrome, we don't listen to the Jones
We give a damn whether you like him or whether he pick up his phone
Smoking cigars on album covers, that nigga thinking he Capone
Who the hell is gassing him up? They got him sipping on Patron
(That was wrong) I mean petroleum, roll with him, wouldn't try
You'd step over to the side and sit it down if you was wise
Dyke Jones just died, ""Chamillion, what is your reply?""
Must of did like my door handles and committed suicide
(Is that right) Messed up cause his thing used to be an anthem
But I only think you pussy when I hear it like a tampon
He'll be working at the dam pond, now I don't drive a Phantom
With the money I make offa this CD I'll probably grab one
Damn, tell me why you had to do that Cham
Cause I don't give a damn how many shows he doing man
I bring beef outside the club like biggity boot that man
And that's 32 chambers less than the Wu-Tang Clan, yep
Four featers, two peoples you already know
Swishahouse ain't gotta screw you cause you already slow
I wasted time chopping, came up wit him at his show
And he was like I gotta go, ""I gotta go snitch on Magno""
Don't step up to the throne, you know you need to back down
Mixtape Messiah 2, I'ma give the streets your whole background
Funny looking rap clown, they gonna look at all your raps now
And say ""Dyke Jones!"" how hilarious does that sound?
He took me off, I ain't tripping, different versions of the song
But that's cool, Dyke Jones isn't gonna be tipping long
Cause he didn't call for back up, too bad he didn't have his phone
That nigga didn't have to roam, that nigga shoulda stayed at home

Wink at me one more time, and I'ma snatch you from him

No need to worry, I already got my ""Revenge""
Now that it's after the win, my platinum plaques are my friends (revenge, revenge ...)
You know who's back to bootleggin again
But I got paper to spend, so that's gonna come to a end (woo! woo! ...)
I'ma gonna show 'em how to attack with a pen
I'll get my victory win, I show it happened again
Because I'm back
Yes (hold up, hold up) [woman's voice screaming]
That's right I'm back

It's the Mixtape Mivasa (he's back!)

Yeah, and I went from platinum out rap 'em
Yeah they thought that that couldn't happen
On the way to the bank, yeah I'm laughin
See the hook's gonna hook 'em like grapplin
Many folks try to dap 'em, but Koopa got what ya lackin
When I come back I'm attackin, that means your future will blacken
Rap is conceited, but Ken is the only famous to us
Better put it in your face, so you taste the ""Flavor of Love""
Rappers cartoons trust me, these dudes ain't slangin them dubs
(No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no)
You got Viagra for bullets, act like your anxious to butt
But you ain't gangsta enough, respect my paper I'm tellin ya
Pockets green as a vegetable, wallet sure lookin edible
Put a 1 then a 0 comma 0, a 0 with no decimal
Throw 'bout 4 more 0's, then you know my dough is incredible (yeah)
You might think your the greatest rapper of all-time
But I just think your the greatest rapper in your mind
(No, no, no, no, no, no, other, no, no, no, no, other)
Especially cause your time, don't look like it's on grind
Your music is guarded like Muslims do to a pork rind
Maybe it's cause I think too much, but each decision's the sure kind
If I think that I hurt you, you'll be the one with the sore mind
I schedule a beat down and adjust it to your time
Tonight, like the first words on Jay Leno's door sign (haha)
My accountant says that my paper's as huge as a mountain [cash register sounds]
The bank tells me this how my deposits usually soundin
(No, no, no, no, no, no, other, no, no, no, no, other)
Company that was bootleggin me, says they movin my thousands
That's as false as 50 executive producing my album (oh)
That's as false as magazine writers that said that I fall (uh huh)
That's as false as me beefin with Slim or Trae, they my dogs (dogs)
That's as false as me still havin a problem with Paul (naw)
I'm a problem, but the other problem that I have is y'all
I'ma let y'all talk while I aim at the industry and bang it
But this ain't no ""True Hollywood"" or no ""E! Entertainment""
(No, no, no, no, no, no, other, no, no, no, no, other, no)
A, B, C, D, take out the A and the name is
The name of the boot L-E-Ggers, they wanna be nameless
I'm the king of the mixtape scene, so they call me your Highness
Why you think that they call me that? My debut was the highest
of hot, hot enough to light up the sky, so get used to the lighters
Spread like wildfires so you should get used to the fires
They some liars (liars) told me that Chamillionaire will be goneee
But it's obvious that the reaper didn't write it in stone
(No, no, no, no, no, no, other, no, no, no, no, other, no)
Resurrected, then I guess that they couldn't bury his bones (my bones)
I'ma stay on point like eyes starin at the top of a cone

No need to worry, I already got my ""Revenge""
Now that it's after the win, my platinum plaques are my friends (cheah)
You know who's back to bootleggin again
But I got paper to spend, so that's gonna come to a end
I'ma gonna show 'em how to attack with a pen
I'll get my victory win, I show it happened again
Because I'm back (haha, I'm back)
That's right I'm back (cheah)

Know what I'm talkin 'bout?
He's back! (Murderers)

Came a long way since all the awards and all the plaques
But I had to come back
This time it ain't about a stack, it's about facts
Know what I'm talkin about?

I know a lot of y'all been hatin
But it's all good

You peeping me take a picture, (you should take a photograph) - [2x]

Catch me today, with a cannon or a Kodak
Cause by tomorrow, yesterday gon be a throwback
(You see it's real, they be like look at that
Picture perfect nigga, you should take a photograph)
[Chamillionaire]
Introducing the truest voice of the South, it's who else but me fool
Don't let all that foolishness they feed you, on T.V. mislead you
Don't let all the magazines, and them papers out there deceive you
The cups that be used to sip, but Caucasian kinda like my tee do
You see that hand be glistening, you see the Sedans we flipping
The hundreds of grands we getting, these units of scans we shipping
You see that Caddy tipping, them thangs on that Caddy twisting
That paint and that candy dripping, that drank and that can is missing
That ain't a Cola, though dry and you feeling sober
Boys trying to switch it over, apply it up in a soda
Home of the Houston hustlers, who grinding and hit the quota
Who fire and hit the doja, you high when you sniff the odor
Told ya you gotta have, a foreign or buy your slab
Afford it then buy it that's, important without it now
You ain't gotta take college class, to see that we bout our cash
You not if you gotta ask, let's take a pic by the slab hol' up
[Hook]
You see my slab, you see my candy slab
Picture perfect nigga, you should take a photograph
You see my chick, you see my chick is bad
Picture perfect nigga, you should take a photograph
You see it's real, they be like look at that
Picture perfect nigga, you should take a photograph
Photograph, ph-ph-ph-photograph-photograph
Picture perfect nigga, you should take a photograph
[Chamillionaire]
When I'm tipping they'll probably watch me, the cops'll be paparazzi
And try to patrol my posse, we shining and glowing glossy
The jealous will try to top me, we keep it too real to copy
What I'm listening to ain't a floppy, that disc gon be Screwed and Chop-pied
All the ballers will ride to this, deposit deposit slips
Buy the car and apply the fifth, raise the trunk an entire lift
Use to go to that Kappa, but Kappa ain't been as crunk
So I'm popping up at Daytona, on chrome and I'm popping trunk
Jamming that ""Ridin' Dirty"", while riding beside the laws
And they staring over at me, trying to scare me like I'ma pause
Tell 'em naw they know I'ma crawl, all day in the robber cause
I'm trying to go wash the ride, till them tires have whiter walls
You peeping him take a picture, that chrome and that paint official
You smoking then take a swisha, there's plenty just take 'em wit ya
You chilling you ain't a sipper, then I'ma be hanging wit ya
Take a hold of the grain and grip a, handful and smile for the pictures nigga
[Hook]
[Bun B]
You see the bling up on my bracelet, and the shine on my chest
Syrup in my styrofoam, it's sweet with doja no cess
You done put it down with the rest, time to roll with the best
Cause when you ride with the original, you ain't gotta guess
I'm the connection that you need, when they say it's a drought
Cause it's not really a drought, them other niggaz just out
And I'm the plug you gotta have, when they say the river's dry
Cause it's not really dry, they just ran out of supply
I'm too fly for the clouds, too down for the green grass
Better wear tinted lenses, if you look at my clean ass
Catch me today, with a cannon or a Kodak
Cause by tomorrow, yesterday gon be a throwback
Candy still dripping, 4's is still tipping
Wood grain grass, steering wheel I'm still gripping
Repping for P.A.T., the West and the East
And I'm repping for Pimp C, till he get back on the streets it never cease
[Hook]
[Chamillionaire]
My life is real baby, ain't just a song (ain't just a song)
Gripping that wood wheel baby, and riding chrome (I'm riding chrome)
This is for the real playas, that get that do' (that get that do')
Tell me how it feel baby, to see I'm-I'm riding candy and chrome
[Bun B]
Catch me today, with a cannon or a Kodak
Cause by tomorrow, yesterday gon be a throwback - [2x]
[talking]
Know I'm saying, gripping wood

You ain't gettin' paper what you up in the game fa'?
Gettin' paper now couldn't be a complainer
Trunk lift up at a acute angle
Isoceles triangle pokin' outta my swangers

So it really ain't a thing you could get free
Unless you tryna get them chains off of Pimp C
We, jammin UGK you see the jewlrey ay!
Cover ya eyes it'll blind like a U.T. Ray
Stay throwed in the game, holdin' the grain (yeah)
Ice and the white gold in my chain
Raisin' the trunk and showin' my bang
Hoes on the swangs while the doors color change

I hit that switch and we movin on up just like George Jefferson's Weezie (yeah)
I'm long, goin off, (what?), that means my baby needs me
I'm ""ghost ridin in my whip"", kinda like Keak Sneak and E-Pheezy
The top be goin down, like it's tryna sexually please me
I'm gonna turn on the radio, but I'm not gonna pop in the CD
Cause they playin my song (what?), like I was havin sex with the PD
I'm ridin with a star and banana, bustas better believe me
The star is my chick, the banana is my clip and you see where
All got expensive cars, won't allow a jacker to see me
I ride with bananas and shells like Mario and Luigi
You know I stay poppin up like a genie, those be the Lamborghini
The ""top down low"" like T.I. Jeezy, Dro, Big Kuntry, and B.G.
Then I pop that trunk and I let it up just so a hater can read me
I got the streets and that's regardless of what you see on TV
Hang my left hand out the window, it's gonna get really breezy
Right now I'm so hot, I'm so on fire, sub-zero couldn't freeze me
Get another plaque, then I'ma go back and party like it's my b-day

the-truth,2005,chamillionaire,Hip-Hop,"[Chamillionaire - Talking]
Yeah...
Chamillionaire..Mixtape Messiah baby
Always want to know something bout me man
want to know somethin bout me?
Don't judge me..don't judge me by my music
And don't judge me bout what you heard about me either
Chamillionaire..listen
Ay, My father was Muslim my momma's a Christian
I couldn't even look surprised when they said they was splittin'
Wasn't no bacon or grits in, off in the kitchen
It was missin', plate was full of non-nutrition
I was born skinny the hunger was forced in me
To get angry at my lifestyle, no smile wasn't born friendly
Born with a thorn in me, I'm scorned so I'm pourin' Remi
I'm thinkin' that's boys feel me, but boys is avoidin' me
Oh, got to excuse me for givin' you the truth
And being the type to give proof that you givin' an excuse
You gotta excuse me for gettin' in the booth,
and keepin' it real about life while you livin' in the poof...
fantasy, damnit he, isn't as big a man as me
If I tell him the truth he need to hear then he gettin' mad at me
The truth could hit ya as hard as assault & battery,
and make people that used to run with me switch up and challenge me
But ain't we family? y'all forgettin' what y'all were
Forget what ya boy heard, 'cause this is 'bout more words
It's all 'bout communication but niggas ignore verbs
If ya boy shouted I'm hatin', then that got ya boy served
Don't deny it if you a man, so you should be man enough
I'm far from feminine we take pisses while standin' up They smokin' on cannibus while they tell us they jammin' us
Look a fan in the face and ask em' ""Are you a true fan or what""?
""Are you really a fan of us""? or are you type to switch
and get pissed and bootleg the disc 'cause I'm not, droppin' em' quick
They love ya and then they diss, they hug ya and then they hiss
They happy when you arrive and go right back to being pissed
Honestly man, I don't really even give a damn
Instead of being who you want me to be I be who I'am
I'm livin' life of my family and live life of Cham'
I don't live life for my fans
And don't, switch up my words just let me explain my thought
I appreciate ya support, I appreciate if ya bought,
my cd's with all ya heart but this music is just an art
But it's not as precious as life in the middle is where I'm caught
Lookin' out for my people, my motive is never evil
My motive was never see-through, my motive was always equal
Outsiders would lie and try to promote it they out (to) decieve you
They give a notice to you, but don't give a notice to me too
Ya, that's somethin' I call divide and conquer
They try to get inside the monster to divide the monster
So they can become the monster, then they'll try to stomp ya
Inside the circle of friends is where you'll find imposters
To hell with y'all niggas

switch-styles,2005,chamillionaire,Hip-Hop,"As we get on the proceedings this evening
Ha-ha, it's Koopa nigga, it's Koopa nigga
Ay man switch styles man, stay switching styles
You know I'm tal'n 'bout, switch everything nigga
Paint switching, no teams
We ain't switching teams baby, ha already
It's Color Changin' Click, hey Mix Tape Messiah
Let's go, let's go, let's go yeah
I was at Strokers in ATL, and they was showing Cham and sluts
My nigga Killa's Klan with us, and did some sh, I can't discuss
They was bad they was yellow, they was saying can you handle us
Pull the door knob on the ceiling, 'cause I'm about to handle up
Showing up at the hotel, now is this chick a fan or what
If she sipping that's a plus, but not that Crys' 'cause that's for us
Come to the hotel wondering if you stripping, that's a must
Make a meal out of my nuts, and open up a can of suck
Controversy sells, I swear I spit a rhyme that'll shock
I wreck so I get respect in the digital underground, like I'm Pac
Labels scheme and they plot, they telling me sign on the dot
I cracked a platinum smile and he knew, that was a sign I would not
No warrants when the laws pull up behind, I'ma stop
Princes cuts the size of a window, I'ma wind down my watch
Pussy passenger still mad, 'cause I'm rewinding on chops
Tossed his work inside my lap, and said that I got the rocks
Screens fall like rain, while my trunk shaking like thunder
[Incomprehensible], my verse sound like a mumble
Onlookers wonder, if I'm level headed or humble
Till I get to speaking bout drama, then I end a sentence with uh-uh
Back that I'm Israel, I'm Istanbul I'm thinking Pakistani
Foreign cars no I'm dressing up, 'cause the only gator comes after Navi
Students getting out of barber school, graduating they getting happy
All my hoes got longer hair, than 'cause of it on the Adams Family
Sixty inch TV screen, I could view from the side angle
In my crib you'll get lost, it's like the Bermuda Triangle
Said I'd knew you'd be a king, so Hakim is what I named you
I told my mama thanks, now the king is what I claim fool
When it comes to this rap game nigga, passionate for it brah
Your CD packages showing up, laughing after it's blowing up
Think I'm playing by my pistol, until I'm smacking it over ya
Shooting spiders off my rims, like I got arach-a-naphobia
St. Lunatics say it's tipped, for me that pimp is the drill
While she tasting my testicles, see the tip of my steel
Know you getting that scrill, pulling up on whips with the grill
And if that slab only got fo' you know, it's missing a wheel
'Cause I'm a Texas tycoon, flat TV screens in my room
So many flakes in my paint, say I need Vidal Sassoon
Fish in the fish tank gon' sip drank, yeah they'll be leaning by noon
And the two Brazilian beauties, come in to clean my lagoon
Won't see no damn silver spoon, inside my mouth just my kitchen
I'm popped up with the trunk up wreck, in other words we tipping
Looked in my garage, noticed a couple cars is missing
Let me see one two three, my bad I'm tripping
Kinda look like I'm crippling, when my paint change to blue
By the way my paint change to red, you would swear I'm claiming that too
Yeah, they be banging that Whoo Kid, and be banging that Clue
But down in Texas the changer, ain't never changing from Screw
Seen the slugs that you spittin' at me
I mean the slugs that you missin' at me
Seen you and you ain't getting at me
Man the game is really getting crappy
ATL with Killa Kill, Status Quo and that Lil' Scrappy
I don't wear no throwbacks, 'cause the trend is really getting tacky
Commercial won't hurt you, 'cause that's gon' get you mo' cash
But spend that cash on security, 'cause we gon' whip your ass
Music slower than a running turtle, tell you what they sip in my circle
Samuel Jackson, Whoopie Goldberg, Oprah Winfrey the color purple
Ha-ha, that was a good one
That was a good one, ha-ha
I told you you don't want problems, you didn't believe it
Go get a bodyguard, 'cause you're gonna need it
We're gonna bomb you, worse than Osama
Get it in your head, nigga I tried to warn ya
All these boys acting like, they be getting do'
But you can't hide the truth, a real baller gon' know
All these boys acting like, they ain't really hoes
But you can't hide the truth, a real nigga gon' know
All these boys acting like, they can call a stone
Let's break these boys off, and let 'em know we got it sowed

Or I was up under ya
Punda ya
When I'm on the cut I can come to ya
And when I bust, you suck it up like a pundaba
You kept a bundle a under ya
Gucci or a Coach bag
Whatever ya got ya gave Smoke had
that's why its so sad...when ya say (ta take meee)
And I gotta disappoint cha
Its not I don't want cha
Its that I got thangs to do peeps to see
Expensive champagnes to drank trees to tree
And drop mo hits than Tina T receive from Ike
And mo classics than rees

We got nothing to lose, take my hand lemme help ya

And we the worst to bread, worse than flees
As long as I work for he, I work for free
He beat me like a dick in jail and cursed at me
I'm certain we, weren't put on this earth to be, Bustled
Nobody deserve to be, hustled
Look here, run I dare ya
I catch ya, I'ma give ya more lashes than mascara
If its pride or die, I'm choosing respect
I saw my daddy hung dead, wit a noose on his neck
My niece got raped pregnant, won't tell she scared
Master done it, but she blaming it on drop dead Fred
But one day, things gon' change for better
Lord knows it can't rain forever
that's what I told my momma
Two days later master sold my momma (master sold my momma)

uh, uh, uh. I'm in the field, that's white lil' niggas and me
From dusk to dawn til the sun come and it leave
Through all seasons, Winter, Fall, Summer, and Spring
Picking, pushing, pulling, cutting the field
Sweating bout to dehydrate, stuck in the heat
and when its cold, joints lock up barker than trees
Rest, I don't get enough of my sleep
cause master got us working late night, and then waking up in the wee
Hours of the morning, stacking stalks of hay
Hoping the rain from dawn til shower day
Wishing I could walk away
But then I think about Hardaway
Master cut off his hand
cause you can't talk or sing or speak from your mouth
If it ain't what master talk or say
But I was taught to pray to the Lord and have faith
Please take me away from this awful place
cause you can be so off today

Man I tell ya drop shit, ain't nothing
nuff suffering, done dealt with more headaches the buffering
Gotta spend my time off the destructive by getting by doe bubbling
can't risk stumbling, fumbling
So I'm bout taking my life, dice tumbling
I drop down the road, trying to get that pot of gold
Still out in the field, mobbing with Sean and Smoke
9 times, nine to five, I'm troop serving
Nine, you bout trying to eat well, get in line
'cause momma got laid off, the lil' sis need shoes
My brother just got popped back in his county blues
and Pops been made it off, there was no money, no food
Coming through next week, my rent and my girl due
Life ain't got no rules, destruction, one-two's
So every now and then, your gonna sing the blues

Hold ya head up
It's hell in the streets boy
Hold your head young nigga, cause it's hell
I'm sittin' in the courtroom, stomach full of butterflies
Somebody help me, cause my life is in the Judge eyes
They got me for a Humbug, and that's some bullshit
I should've listened to them preachers in the pulpit
Stressin' to help me, seemed like I was born by mistake
While the races dominate, got me victim to the Legislate'
I'm playin' for kicks, hustle and rob reefer, it medicated my mind
Fuck the World, we cried
My mamma died in 92 so crazy, what the fuck to do?
Daddy smokin' hard, and I know one day it currupt him to chillin'
I'm starin' at the celin', can't take too many blows
The pain be killin', got the silence up through my nose, oh
These people want to hurt me, my momma dead so fuck 'em
A small timer on the rise, so nothin' I feel
To my niggas in the county, I might do a bit with ya
Boy, in the streets I don't care with ya my nigga
Cause it's hell
Livin' off a thug, money things ain't swell
Don't believe me, go and ask my boys in jail
When we cryin' keep a knock for the cops
Cause ain't no sunshine for boys or blocks, my nigga
Cause it's hell
What we gotta go through, and only time will tell
When the pain is over, I'm down on my knees
Lord keep watchin' over
I'm lookin' for a better way
And I that's all I gotta say
Now I was born broke, but I'll be damned if I'm a die that way
Love my momma, can't deny that face
And as a child, everynight I prayed
For a rap record deal, man sometimes, twice I'd say
Lord save me, take me, away from here
20 To 9, and I've been sellin' yay' for years
But why we had a house, and couldn't keep it?
Why we evicted?
Why we get more pink slips than Victorias Secret?
Why I gotta rob?
Why my pappi ain't gotta job?
Why I ain't graduate?
Why through high school I didn't have a date?
Why I had to masturbate?
Why Im wearing hand me downs?
Why im in and out of jail?
Why I let my family down?
Why my uncle died?
Wish it would've been me
He ain't rob, he ain't hustle, should've been me
Preacher man, could you pray for me, faithfully?
When God comes lay him his herbs, tell him wait for me
It's hell
Livin' off a thug, money things ain't swell
Don't believe me, go and ask my boys in jail
When we cryin' keep an eye for the cops
Cause ain't no sunshine for boys or blocks, my nigga

What we gotta go through, and only time will tell
When the pain is over, I'm down on my knees
Lord keep watchin' over
I'm lookin' for a better way
And that's all I gotta say
He just keep layin' his hands on my momma again
Family ties, this is where the drama begins
Tellin' my momma on the floor, bitch this and bitch that
Locked in my prayin' to God, Please let me get back
He's trippin' like he's outta control
So he had to of been smokin' the herb to croke
Through the wall, she was gaggin' and chokin'
11 Years old, and I don't need to be seein' this shit
But in my tape deck, 8ball talkin' about beatin' a bitch
It got me confused, but damn, you shouldn't of popped her that hard
And when them folks come through, her stupid ass be droppin' the charge
Whippin' her ass like a man, right and left with his fists
And when he blows to the dome, now she sliced her wrists
I'm hyped and I'm pissed, so I wipe the blood holdin' her limb
It's gonna be all right, I was with in her bleedin' guilt
She passed out, eyes rolled back, I'm tryin' not to panic
Stepdaddy walked in, saw my momma, then he went in a frantic
Blood leakin', it won't stop, him and the rush of the fever
She almost died, of loss of blood
I knew my momma wouldn't leave me
She don't deserve to live in pain, she just wanted to be happy
Feelin' like a pussy, I didn't help her cuz he ain't even my daddy
She's back at home, and puttin' his hands on her again
Livin' in the turn of fire, where drama doesn't end
It's hell
Nobody knows, than Lord, my soul's hope
Nobody knows, than Lord, my soul's hope

Honey you lookin' good, and mo' gooder than a late of neck bones
Tenderized and yummy, the Energizer bunny can't compete with me

With mo' motion than ya ocean from night to mornin'
Hit it huffin' and puffin', breath stankin' and yawnin'

cut-loose,2002,field-mob,Hip-Hop,"[Verse One: Kalage]
My shorty done cut me loose, and left me in the wind
Got a new man wit a Ph.D. and cheese, but he pees in the pants
He's 60, she's in her 20's, she said I be hard in her, overworking her
And when I hit from back it feels like I'm birthing her
She said I'm wrong for her, too long for her
But she never complained when I bought my ex home for her
But now she dropped me, like the pen at the end of a Sprint commercial
I try to hit it she be like no, like Laura Winslow to Urkel
And What if I did misuse and abuse your clique, I'll apoligize
'Cause I ain't know ruler sticks would bruise the clique
I saw it on tape tried to do the shit
Now, she say she want somebody simple
She say she want somebody gentle
She said, when I got head, I dug in her cheek now she got a dimple
I, I, I mean she cute with it though, I, I couldn't help it
The way she swallowed my pelvis
Had me seeing shit, had a nigga reaching for Elvis
And I come on her head, that some I'm a miss
That girl gave my dick more hickeys than a damn redneck locksmith
[Chorus: repeat 2X]
My shorty done cut me loose
She fucking other niggas and she fucking me too
She say she don't want no more
If she feeling like I'm feeling then she won't go
My shorty done cut me loose
She fucking other niggas and she fucking me too
She say she don't want no more
She say she don't want no more
[Verse Two: Boondox Blak]
I woke up this morning stretching,yawning with a hard on ??? ready to bone
Then I reached on my right and realized my woman's gone
I got to bring her to bed to hit her some more, but I found this envelope
Sitting on the pillow, I opened it, unfolded it, it said Dear Smoke
Hey, it's me Little Debbie Cake, and I feel it's best we separate
At least until I'm in better shape
cause I'm doing my best to shut up and take
The way you ramming inches in me
Slam me in different positions
Grasp and grip my hips and titties
Put one leg up drag and flip me
Fucking me up, down, back, to front
(How you squeezing and smacking my butt)
From right to left, left to right
(and peeing across my breast and thighs)
Fucking me early Monday, again on Tuesday
humpday Wednesday, then come Thursday
Twice on Friday and Saturday, and after church on Sunday
Hurting my stomach, beating the cock
But trip when I ask you to eat me twice, so we need to stop
Cause lately I been bleeding a lot, so I'm leaving you dox
To find someone that's fair and square
And not so hairy there, who fucks me there with care
Cause you put too much wear and tear on my derriere
[Chorus] - repeat 2X"

All in my face feelin' me
We was up in the club
Fillin' these with all the intention we sip of Hennessey
My friend and me, I caught my niggas killin' me
Testin' weed until the enemy got the Tennessee
To hinder me, all in my face feelin' me
Bud we pretend to weed, Hennessey to silly games
Gangstas throwin' them signs up and up and down
Bumpin' enemies sayin' things that offendin' me
Still here and we ballin' half drunk, passin' out song after song
Inhalin' gun after gun, passin' out blunt after blunt, havin' fun
Them niggas took a jab at me, then one push from the back of me
Tryin' to tackle me and wrestle me
Couldn't get me down, so they hit me in the back and beat
They had me badly beaten
I gotta gash in me, but it was just a scratch to me
At first did get some Vaseline
A half a week, it cleared up fast and clean
To a scratch you were bad to see, so I ain't mad to see
I want to squash and flatten and beat
Like White Castle's and crystal square beef patties beat
'Cause I'm so sick of you harassin' me and playin' with me
So can we canopy?
Before we 'cause a tragedy and someone pain and agony
But if you feel you can handle me and still wanna take the man in me
This time I'll have to shut you down, like Sunshine Hennesin', because
I don't want no problems
And you don't want no problems, so
Better leave me alone and gone on

Ow, ow, ouch, it hurts so bad
It hurts so bad
I'm from the home of racist rednecks and confederate flags
You could strand them hussies, politicians and drags
Cotton pickin', slave tradin' and nigga lynchin'
Lead to more oppression, me cricket caught trigger pinchin'
Ridin' along, mindin' my own business, God as my witness
It was five in the morn', passin' along, hop in the corner
No, police, hold up, turn the radio down
Put your seatbelt on, shit, God damn
Give me the fuckin' weed, he's gone
John, what? He kept goin'
It's like I got enemy's, 'cause of my race they hate me
Fuck pullin' over, chase me
Guess it's safe to say it makes me crazy
Can't give up, 'cause this hate it makes me
Wanna grab an AK spray strays on 8th street
8 ways and blaze the day bleed
E E 8 D D E 8 be
Tryin' to say we pull more keys than a leash of ladies
Well, okay, hate me, say we crazy but lately, baby
Even criticizin' the way we say things
I pray everyday, but the way he hating
I wish Jeff Dahmer was here, why?
So he could eat President Bush's baked beans
That's why I've been a crook since 18
Leave me alone, listen to what the hook is saying

Haters!
Hatin' cause my 20's be..choppin! choppin!
Hatin' cause these hoes be..jockin! jockin!
Try me and my glock'll be..cockin! poppin!
Why you want to player hate on me?
Is it the big truck sittin' up on mike Jordans...that's 23's
With the big ole owl, dual heads roaring
Or is it the caprice sittin' Emmitt smiths...that's 22's
On the impala on 20 inches
Mo' wood in it than old abe lincoln's cabin
And with mo' glass in it, than in your cabinets
Or is it the way we come down watchin' xxx
White sex from the ceilin', visors, and headrests
Or is it the ?? chain, the Gucci hat, the gucci air Jordan retros to match
Even though I step on the scene, so fresh and so clean
Nice takin' with me, I still got my weapon wit' me
Strapped wit' a tech in my jeans
Ready to squeeze, cause I know you haters get tempted to wear my
Neck-a-lace.
[Chorus: x2]
Now just imagine if there wasn't no real niggas
No hustlers, thugstas, mobstas, and field niggas
On the real, t double d, I still keep it real
I love the streets that you fuck niggas named haterville
Lied on me, said I was a murderer, said I used to serve you work
But I ain't never heard of you
I love dub-deuces, only cause I'm sittin on em
And once again I'm gunnin, copped the big 500
A Chevy boy, candy green and chrome fronted
Niggas hide out or they ride out cause my shit runnin
I sold more oz's than cd's and lp's
Baby, I'm a thug plus I'm og
I roll 'em heavy, I'm bout my fetti
And the feds is what I'm headed
If you fuck niggas keep tellin'.
[Chorus: x2]
I was sittin in the rankin, 69 ??
And ceelo twankys (choppin)
4 15' subwoofers (blasting)
I don't like that nigga, fuck that nigga
Man, I want to shoot, slap, punch, kick, cut that niggaa!
That's what they say on the low
We're losing himmmm!
That's what paramedics'll say
While you lay on the floor
Can we all just get along? smoke trees, hit a bong
Haters pussy niggas, so I'm a choke 'em wit' a thong
Even the block envy me, I make a mill wit' the flo'
But I'm better wit' coke and hot hennessey
My peers is like queers they only get mad
'Cause I ride rims old enough to buy beers
They smileeee while hatin' but when it comes to fakes
I spot more than dalmations

all-i-know,2002,field-mob,Hip-Hop,"[Intro: Cee-Lo]
It's 6 O'clock, it's volume 1
Yeah, Greg Street's mixtape
[Verse One: Boondox]
Uh uh
I came up in the hood infested with teenage hustlers
Street grinders, paper chasin scrapin busters
By keepin dust up noses and caine homes; pipes and cans
So they want they ride candy painted just like the man
That Veta tryin not to bite his hand
But they need em to keep em life from they stand
Every night praying for praying go as far as the ceiling
Got me feel like I'm (cursed) from this heart that I'm dealing
And all this liquor hoeing brother and goose-neckin
That I do but I don't want to got me losing blessings
GOD said he'll take the next two steps if I take the first (I did)
But in it to pick and sellin the spur
From under my feet, lost faith and jump in the street
Back to serve a rocks dying to the chrome in the heat
And running with G's that take it to the block with 'em
Tellin me along with my greens up like pot nickel
[Chorus: Cee-Lo]
Well, all I know
That I'd been down this road before
It ain't the first time, won't be the last
I gotta slow down cause I'm living too fast
It's time to admit I need some help
Still living with my momma, can't feed myself
Life ain't about who straight, who real, who fake, and who gay
It's about who pray
[Verse Two: Cee-Lo]
You can clock my consistent and endless
Efforts up uplift me
Trees and branches catch draft
When I'm choppin down a path-
To walk down, actually don't even know how talk sound
I'm trying to stop the next step they drawing the chalk round
Matter-of-factually, I'll stand alone with no entourage to back me
GOD is my every existence; exhalation, exactly
I'll pimp prophets so profounding labels don't like contract me
I'm one of a kind; they gotta find a satellite to contact me
Let us bow, I thank the Almighty GOD for right now
For the strictor, smile through the tribulation and trial
For sparing me when the devil was daring me
And scaring me, synonymous for preparing me
And to my family- the Dungeon Family
And ya'll family-- we all family
And to me health and home and my son Keith Stun
My tongue is my gun, revolutions already begun
(Whaa)
[Chorus: Cee-Lo]
Well, all I know
That I'd been down this road before
It ain't the first time, won't be the last
I gotta slow down cause I'm living too fast
It's time to admit I need some help
Still living with my momma, can't feed myself
Life ain't about who straight, who real, who fake, and who gay
It's about who pray
[Verse Three: Kalage]
All I know is charge cards, cars, and clothes
Maan, it's all for sure
And could go and when it's gone- (you alone)
Runnin up yo cell phone callin GOD for hope
And who to say that day ain't all for close
And if you ballin playa, it's only because GOD's your coach
And it don't bout the lies you hold, laws you broke
Thangs ya drink, dank and cigars you smoke
HE gonna forgive and that's you; now don't get me wrong
I like LL, but GOD da G.O.A.T'
HE da greatest of all time, if I'm lying I'm blind
Can I get a Amen (Amen brother)
But we got to stop, we got to stop doin dirt
Coming to Church with a devil tucked in your purse
Sittin some leather from Atlanta, came up finish the prayer
Worried about sister mom's and hair
All along worried bout what sister mom gonna wear
This ya boy or should they ride the martyr there
It don't matter at least that's the moral there
In Sunday service with a Bible lie defer the South
But GOD bless her, we here to thank GOD (hmmmm ahhh)
And that's the step inside Holy Church thinkin
I said step inside his Holy Church thinkin
We all God's Property, and not just Kirk Franklin
[Chorus: Cee-Lo]
Well, all I know
That I'd been down this road before
It ain't the first time, won't be the last
I gotta slow down cause I'm living too fast
It's time to admit I need some help
Still living with my momma, can't feed myself
Life ain't about who straight, who real, who fake, and who gay
It's about who pray
[T.I. and studio engineers interlude convo]
[Verse Four: T.I.]
Open my eyes, see the sunrise
Talkin about memories of G's got my tongue tied
Put out some Henn for my friend, why the good die?
But til the end, I'm in the wind where the slug fly
Pray for my sins, I hope I find Heaven close to me
Try to be godly but these haters provokin me
Pull the shotty want them dead is what my heart say
My hard head make me learn shit the hard way
Dodging the fedz ain't the easy way to live, care
But nigga do it everyday to make a meal stack
Your phone tapped, under surveillance, secretly indicted
Being watched daily, livin shady just to drive a Merdede
And fucking ladies, who making babies used against you
Gettin the ?? be the main nigga you be a friend too
How can begin to explain the pain
Can you stay in the rain
Used to be a simple thing, but the game done changed
Now slanging caine is a lifestyle
Risking your freedom just to ball for a short while
Gettin buckwild on the street up on Westside
Downtown Atlanta, while we ride some of the best die
From cocking hammers of these Tec-9s and .45s
Excuse my grammar; but it's fucked up how time fly
It seem like yesterday we play until our days was nights
And yesterday, I just put flowers at his gravesite and that ain't right
[Outro: Kalage]
All I know
Is I'd been down this road before
This ain't the first time, won't be the last
I gotta slow down cause I'm living too fast
It's time to admit I need some help
Still living with my momma, can't feed myself
Life ain't about who straight, who real, who fake, and who gay
It's about who pray"
dimez,2000,field-mob,Hip-Hop,"I'm lookin' for a made misses, not one of them lazy chickens
But one them on top of her game, paid bitches
I lay bitches and slay bitches, fast and free
So fuck that, I want a lady, I can give cash to be
A lover, makin' me say ""Ungh"" like Master P
And helpin' me out when I'm deep in a catastrophe
She has to be, top notch and full of class
Or rollin' a new drop top full a gas, to pull her ass
Gotta come correct and you better have your game tight
She ain't the type of girl you meet and then fuck the same night
She's a hot girl, one that you can smoke Jane with
But so jazzy, flashin' her diamonds on her bracelet
She don't say shit, keepin' our love on the d low
I trust and believe in her, like Shiraz, she's my hero
She don't need no zero's she want a jazzy dime nigga to kick it with
Splittin' it fifty, fifty down the middle
I need a jazzy bitch, a classy bitch
Walkin' and pass me the switch, flashin' her wrist
Where ya at ma'?
I'm lookin' for ya, so let a nigga spoil ya
As if I was your daddy and you was my daughter
I need a jazzy bitch, a classy bitch
Walkin' and pass me the switch, flashin' her wrist
Where ya at ma'?
I'm lookin' for ya, so let a nigga spoil ya
As if I was your daddy and you was my daughter
She had broke niggas and had tonight hoe niggas
Showboat poor niggas perpetratin' with no scrilla
She like more zippers, flow flippers and go getters
Hydro twistas, gold grillers to roll with
And you don't have to be a dope dealer or an old nigga
So don't go twistin' with a gold nigga
'Cause she's a boss bitch, a slim Diana Ross bitch
That you can floss with that don't cost shit
And anytime I want to I can toss it
And when I toss it, I ain't gon' lie, I raw dog it
'Cause she's so jazzy, every five minutes I stop and tell her
Bitches playa hate because they not, they jealous
Long micros with lots of cheddar
Givin' me more D's than Jay Z, she'll Roc A Fella
Classy, I gots to say it in a capella
So y'all rats can hear me clear, y'all gots to do better

Walkin' and pass me the switch, flashin' her wrist
Where ya at ma'?
I'm lookin' for ya, so let a nigga spoil ya
As if I was your daddy and you was my daughter
If you feel that you's a jazzy nigga, you feel the same as me
Jazzy hoe's, I feel ya Jermaine Dupri
Because classy ain't the thing to be and yes it's plain to see
If you a skank you can't hang with me
No, I can't have no rat claimin' me, like a leech, clang to me
Or much, you should be shamed to be
Ridin' in the Chevy thing with me, it's not the place for them
Jazzy, classy girls I'm chasin' them, I wanna stay with them
And lay with them, passin' pussy's not the way for them
I'm lacin' 'em with more ice than a hockey stadium
She gets down with me, freakin' in any position
Fine as all our dough, no, don't need me no pigeon
I'm needin' a pinchin' to make sure that I'm not dreaming
Like Cash Money, when you see her it's like bling, bling

channel-613-part-1,2000,field-mob,Hip-Hop,"I woke up on Fox found myself starring on Cops
Got chased by squad cars and cameras for two blocks
I hate the man yea I ran
To HBO and stole lethal weapons From Mel and Dan Glover's hand
Ran back to Fox found Martin
Me and Bruhman from the fifth floor
Climbed throught the window
From his apartment
Ran up on'em, had a mask on gat in each hand
Robbed Martin, Tommy, Cole, Gena and Pam
Told'em gimmie your bread, mayo, cheese and ham
Took two sandmiches and Stole Cole's Grand Am
Left in a hurry heard footsteps, looked in the rearview
Is this an earthquake? Naw its Big Shirley
She came after the bucket of chicken and clole slaw
Cole bought last week and left in the back seat
I jumped out and just kept running until my chest hurt
Hooked up with Forest Gump and ran to Cartoon Network
I gotta find Bubba, shut up he been dead
Big Shirley probably ate him and Lieutenant Dan's Legs
I need Jenny, damn sure do cause right now
The only thing that can stop Big Shilrey is Jenny Craig
I aint goin to jail, I aint goin to jail
Aw man I aint even did nothin
Shit man I aint goin to jail
Now I'm a wanted fugitive, runin with hot gats
Duck'n the cops from Fox and the fuck'n Swat Cats
Damn, here come Batman in the batmobile
Floss'n on four vowed rims, with four coats of steal tryna catch me
But I ran fast, he couldn't grab me
I jumped in the green van wit Scooby-Doo and Shaggy
I put the gun to Shag's head said don't look back
And told Scooby, play dead and gimmie your Scooby snacks
Then we drove way reached the stop sign at a four way
I hopped out and rode with O.J, rode the whole day
He told me caught Nicole and Ron Gold doin four play
Killed'em both and throwed way the bloody glove in an old lake
I aint sayin he shoulda killed her but I understand
Picture yo broad riden in yo car with another man
You given yo deisel and she blowin a hudred grand
Goin shoppin, call Cochran tell Cato to take the stand
He took me to set it off with four delighted bitches wit glocks
You know Kim, Latifah, Jada, Vivaca Fox
Went in the bank strapped with A.K's
This is a raid everybody throw lay down the hay
Aight don't nobody mothafuckin move
This a mothafuckin robbery, lay down
Come here, come here, come here bitch
Put the money in the motherfukin bag
You don't wanna die, hurry the fuck up
I stashed my half of cash in the dashboard of a stolen Ford Escort
Changed clothes and drove to the airport
Flew to the island of MTV but go figure
Besides Tyrese and Ananda, I aint see no niggas
And I stayed for three whole days and layed low
Kidnapped the cast of Road Rules and stole the Winne Bago
Rode to Rap City bumpin U.G.K and Jigga
Spend the night in the basement with the Hot Boys and Mama Tigga
Man she can cook
She made some pig feet, some greens, some hogmog
Man anyway
Woke up the next mornin yawnin what the fuck is this?
Man get the camera out my face, he said you've just been hit
That's when I met her, I swear to god I never forget her
A fine big doonk senorita and her name Cita
She was jazzy yea she had computer generated skin
But hell at least her ass wasn't ashy
I took her home and down loaded my hard drive
For bout five straight hours right between her thighs"

Don't disguise the dirt then 'cause we all know rocks
It's the real reason furniture go to the pawn shop
'Cause ya crackhead 'cause smokin' the car antennas
I understand see, it's a junkie in every family
'Member hand-me-down, tight pants, lookin' slim in 'em
If they too big, what you do? Put a hem in 'em
'Member talkin' over the loud sounds when the wind blow
'Cause the trash bag's replacin' yo' car window
Man, I been po', I been poor, we been po'
That's how it is in the Field, for real

Adam and Eve couldn't even true to each other
So how you expect me and another shawty
I ain't lyin I ain't lyin
I ain't gone lie
I admit I just wanted to fuck some
Get cha, split cha, hit cha and trick you to suck some
Love and leave ya, like Tina and Rick James
But I fell for your jazzy class and trick games
Your in the process, I'm just tryin to get cha naked
Not slip the bullet see and plus that you should be respected
Never neglected gave you my all and all
I bought your jewelry, nails hairdos and all your draws
I call and call, straight bug-a-booin for real
That's when I knew this never imagine love for you was trill
Makin love was like heaven right here on your couch
Beatin and diggin each morning (smoke don't stop)
My wife, damn right and proud to say it
My lady, I can trust I done finally made it
My main thang, my lil' shawty, my old lady
Took coversation wit my homies, this hoe crazy
This hoe think we be goin on trips and fuckin groupie hoes
And I be lyin when I say I'm at the studio
Listen'n to he said, she said so she went and cheated
She be givin me head and him, too
Heard you be caken him and call'n him boo
I want back my pink ice rings and Tim boots
You can get back all this bullshit you bought me
Fooled me, had me think'n you was my shawty, shawty
Caught her fucked up, can't say shit so keep ya trap shut
Knowin ya wrong on my phone and I know when I tapped up
You was my main Roni
Got all your game from me
But then you changed on me
I, I, I never would have thought that you was cheatin on me
'Cause you got game from me
Shiny diamond rings from me
But then you changed on me
I, I, I never would have thought that you was cheatin on me
I know it was plain for me
But now it's plain to see
You're not the dame for me
I, I, I never would have thought that you was cheatin on me
'Cause you put shame on me
You left me to hang Roni
Love'll never be the same for me
I, I never would have thought that you was cheatin on me
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Back in the day
When I thought about us girl I thought about marriage
Me, you, new crib kids and a carriage
Thought everything was all good all gravy
You was my Hope I was your Bo Brady
For real, I loveded you so much
My damn dick got hard think'n about your touch
You were sweeter than candy
And had a pussy print that look like a midget man
Standin in your panties
Fine motherfucker thick thighs, boleggs
Thought you was a queen, hell yea I broke bread
For slow sex and more head than asprin
Lately huff'n and puff'n, bus'n nuts gaspin
For air, grabbin your hair, you booted over
Never reachin the bed legs spread on the sofa
Gave you my time and money that's all I had
I ain't ask you for shit but you gave me crap
Yea I heard you was fuck'n and suck'n my boy Dennis
(sean let me explain) wait a minute let me finish
While I be at the job work'n bus'n my ass
You be sneak'n and creep'n the street fuck'n for cash
I can't believe this shit girl I loveded you
Now I wish I wouldn't even fucked wit you
You can use the phone you better call Tyrone
Pack your shit and be gone when I come back home
You was my main Roni
Got all your game from me
But then you changed on me
I, I, I never would have thought that you was cheatin on me
You was my main Roni
Got all your game from me

Shit we comin' after the whack rappers
Studio gat-clappers slash jackers

And I'm backed up like brake lights don't beep me
That's some shit you ain't gon' see like a punch in a snake fight
Or a preacher that play dice
It's another level bitch
And I'm sick of rappers braggin' bout they diamond bezelled wrists
My ice this, my ice that
I bet I'll melt yo shit
Cause Shawn J come hotter than the Devil's dick
Couldn't beat me if I was yo dick
We were in the movies
Watchin' porn flicks in 3D
And you were PeeWee
I don't blow shit out of proportion
I'll stuff you in yo mama's stomach
Rap her then make her have an abortion
The Vince Carter of rap, Shawn tall and brown skinned
Dunkin' dick in yo bitch with my arm in the rim
Keep yo hoe I chase dough
Burnin' rappers till sun-up
And jackin' off layin' on my back tryin' to come up
To get grip
Shawn slick with bricks for chips
I flip one-fifth of a brick
Nicks go for 6
Tug a four-fifth with more glits than 6 twists
I don't sniff but I spit
Catch a whiff nit-wit
Slick 6 style switch
Like a whip stick shift
I stole rap like the grinch stole Christmas
My clique pissed tryin' to hit licks to get grip
Tryin' to make more bread than Bisquick Biscuits
This misfit pissed cause I hit his chick
He mad cause I'm Indiana like Rik Smits
But he don't know I'm underground like the Ninja Turtle
He want to fight but he type that couldn't injure Urkel
I play the cut though
Mr. Nice guy slash cut throat
Spit doo-doo like you butt blow
UH-OHHHH y'all best to get runnnin'
Why? Shhh! I hear Field Mob comin'

Uh, it's you boy Boondox aka Smoke from the Mob
That charcoal color lyrical criminal spittin' flows from yo ?
I break bricks down in yo hood and take over yo block
Whatever you want I got it from the South Coast to the Rocks
Open up shop totin' a glock with a scope on the top
Two clips in each ankle tucked low in my sock
Like lil' whodi Wayne ? I'll have yo block scorchin' hot
You need oven gloves to get yo mail out of yo box
To you rappers thinkin' you gonna come control my block
Check yo face you see a infrared now way it's not
Close to yo eye and in yo ears and all up in yo teeth too
So many red dots look like you sick with the measles
My clique hold heat too
But I roll with more people
Macks like Rudy Ray Moore, Goldie and Seigel
Like Bebe we don't die we multiply like wet gremlins
Jack Martin girl
It's best you hide the baguettes listen
We the best spittin' gold rhymes
Lyrics stickin' to yo brain as if yo pillow was porcupine
Not only yo mind
I poke yo tummy like Doughboy
Makin' ya bummy
Droppin' lyrical bows to yo stomach
Smokey done it in two years and 4 weeks
I ain't lying
If Jigga Jordan
You can call me the Kobe Bryant of this rap shit
So go get more practice
I skipped college and high school ? I ain't even pass it
Barely made it past the 10th grade
You been writin' for 20 years
And still writin' and I been in this shit getting' paid
Spittin' raid at you cockroaches
It makes you move out the way if you did not notice

Body like a Buick bumpin', jumpin' and jigglin'
Butt look like big lips talkin' and whisperin'
Sayin' and her voice so feminine
Either her booty talkin' or my Hennessey kickin' in
I smile, give a grin, grab that butt with both hands
Man she moved it over and started hunchin' my Jimmy then
See, I'm gon' hit her then switch up and stick her friend
I'm skinny built like a spoon, they grits I'm diggin' in
I don't be spendin' ends but they gon' givin' chin
They lick it and kiss it then say
They pagin' and beepin', beggin' for me to come hit again

Big breasts are proper set, her game, she on top of it

Micro's and contacts, ooh, I wanna knock her dead
Vicky Secret scents in the air, why I want her pop her leg
I heard in the streets that shawty give lots of head
Good hot my mouth too, have you jumpin' up out the bed
And plus shawty rock baguettes, chickens wanna chop her head
Off 'cause she jazzy with more cheese than broccoli
We on the dance floor, from side to side she rockin' it
Toot it up and stoppin' it then droppin' and poppin' it
She said ""Ooh, you on hard"" I had to stop and check
Pants pokin', I knew then her number I gotta get

Earring in yo tongue, you dark and you lovely
Fine from yo heels up,but yo toes ugly
Plus it ain't bubbley, the back part
I ain't actin' hard, but you ain't touchin' me
Look, them tight Capri pants be fittin' her right
But her booty is much bigger, so that's what I like
I know a lot of shawty's out there sayin' that's not right
But she the jazziest and that's what I'ma take home tonight
A me say, I know a little girl by the name of Suzy
She look so sweet and she really sexy
I go home and she take off my shoe
Say ""Ohh Paparuby, let me make love to you""
On top my mind, me say ""My, my, my""
The woman on top of the woman is a lesbian
But the Ruby on top of woman it's a stylin' fashion
Stylin' fashion, it's a stylin' fashion

Had a hooker mom, like Alfred she Hitchcock
Bumped dad, 'cause when he visit it was like a pit stop
I lived knock hard, like Jay-Z, boy ya won
Things got harder, at age eighteen, I bought a gun
A three-eighty caliber, for street crazy scavengers
Tryna take my ???, I'll turn your hat lavender
Sacks of herb in my pocket I smoke eventually
Supposed to be sellin 'em, but it's hard to give 'em away
Livin the day for tomorrow, so on the down-low
I used beats and rhymes, why not, look at me now
From flippin dimes, playin get like me to get a dollar
To ridin on my own twenties in my Impala, I ain't cryin

Well, I been hearin a lotta people say that blood's thicker than water
Well answer this then, which would you swallow?
I said that to say, it don't matter, friend or kin
Shawn ain't my cousin but he here through thick and thin

Intention leads to action, that is my theme
So pay attention now as I begin to recap
Puttin' words and ideas stacked back to back
Some rhymes go flat, well mine go fizz

Well I don't shoot blanks and I don't shoot lead
'Cause I'm a freaky streaker like Winnie the Pooh
A T-shirt and no pants and I dance the boogaloo
Like George Whipple on New York One
Got a hairy (ew!) and that's no fun

Simmer in the pan 'cause, I ain't flashin'
I'm party-crashin' so you better batten
Down those hatches stop procrastin'
Well I'm Mike D with a story to tell
And when I rock the crowd the crowd we all yell
And when I get the feeling I feel the feel swell
'Cause when I start to rhyme well I rhyme the rhyme well
Went to the top and never went pop and
Came back down but still not stopping
I'm not even asking, ""yo what's cracking?""
Serving MC's on a platter like baked Alaskan
So start packing because I'm back in
The game of hi-phop representing Manhattan
Now push the pause button then start ducking
Shh, you heard me like I'm E.F. Hutton

From the Battery to the top of Manhattan
Asian, Middle-Eastern and Latin
Black, White, New York you make it happen
Brownstones, water towers, trees, skyscrapers
Writers, prize fighters and Wall Street traders
We come together on the subway cars
Diversity unified, whoever you are
We're doing fine on the One and Nine line
On the L we're doin' swell
On the number Ten bus we fight and fuss
You know we're thorough in the boroughs 'cause that's a must
I remember when the Duece was all porno flicks
Running home after school to play PIX
At lunch I'd go to Blimpies down on Montague Street
And hit the Fulton Street Mall for the sneakers on my feet
Dear New York I hope you're doing well
I know a lot's happened and you've been through hell
So, we give thanks for providing a home
Through your gates at Ellis Island we passed in droves
Brooklyn, Bronx, Queens and Staten
From the Battery to the top of Manhattan
Asian, Middle-Eastern and Latin
Black, White, New York you make it happen
The L.I.E. the B.Q.E
Hippies at the band shell with the L.S.D.
Get my BVDs from VIM
You know I'm reppin' Manhattan the best I can
Stopped off at Bleeker Bob's, got thrown out
Sneakin' in at four am after going out
You didn't rob me in the park at Dianna Ross
But everybody started looting when the light went off
From the South South Bronx on out to Queens Bridge
From Hollis Queens right down to Bay Ridge
From Castle Hill to the Lower East Side
From ten-ten WINS to Live At Five
Dear New York, this is a love letter
To you and how you brought us together
We can't say enough about all you do
'Cause in the city we're ourselves and electric too
Brooklyn, Bronx, Queens and Staten
From the Battery to the top of Manhattan
Asian, Middle-Eastern and Latin
Black, White, New York you make it happen
Shout out the South Bronx where my mom hails from
Right next to High Bridge across from Harlem
To the Grand Concourse where my mom and dad met
Before they moved on down to the Upper West
I see you're still strong after all that's gone on
Lifelong, we dedicate this song
Just a little something to show some respect
To the city that blends and mends and tests
Since 9-11 we're still livin'
And lovin' life we've been given
Ain't nothing gonna take that away from us
We lookin' pretty and gritty 'cause in the city we trust
Dear New York I know a lot has changed
Two towers down but you're still in the game
Home to the many, rejecting no-one
Accepting peoples of all places, wherever they're from
Brooklyn, Bronx, Queens and Staten
From the Battery to the top of Manhattan
Asian, Middle-Eastern and Latin
Black, White, New York you make it happen
Brooklyn, Bronx, Queens and Staten
From the Battery to the top of Manhattan

We're international like Matt Takei
Rock the mic from Munich out to Taipei
Still around the way is where we'll stay
Say what we mean, mean what we say
Trajectories from the past are taking their toll and

I'm getting kind of tired of the situation
The US attacking other nations
Anhiliations, on every station
False election's got me losing my patience
Well, I'm a funky-ass Jew and I'm on my way, and
I got to say fuck the KKK, and
Oh, yeah hey, how about today?

I went to get a loan and they asked my race
I wrote down human inside the space
It's a disgrace how they try to debase
It ain't the bank's damn business how my lineage trace
Now let me drop a verse that's terse and concise
I'm an iron chef when I slice and dice
With the rhyme precise, the word is nice
So please pass me the Reunite on ice
Well let's go to work and not berserk
'Cause when the time comes the body goes to dirt
Try to smooth it out like Levert
Keep the mind alert and not revert

Beastie Boys in the place up in the space

You better think twice before you start flossing
I been in your bathroom often
Taking punk MCs out, I'm all about
My to-do list today is turn the party out
Getting hot in here no room to breathe
I got my pen in my hand so you best not sleep
No, I'm not Herman Munster or Dr. Spock
I go by the name of the King Adrock
So here's a match, my ass and your face
Listen when I tell you dog
I'm in your crawlspace (crawlspace)

Bite my rhymes with a scanner from Radio Shack
You suckers try to front like you've got the force
But I'll slay like Vader sip you for a first course
Don't even get me started on that intercourse, aah!
Don't step into my zone or even periphery
Can't grab a hold of my style it's too slippery
The way you act a fool son you can't erase
And you're running on your way like steeple chase
You tried to take my title now put it back in place
But now you're busted wearing panties and lace
Stealing my style from that trophy case
But my drive's secure like on an army base
You're sneaking and peeking and trying to give chase
But you ain't never gonna catch me, I'm in your crawlspace (crawlspace)
Schematics, blueprints and microfilm
Calibrate your sonar when I'm in your realm
'Cause you know we're getting scarier and scarier
And this extends beyond the Tri-State Area
Omnipresent and omnipotent
My rhymes are whales and yours are rodents
This means huge compared to very small
You look a little chilly, can I get you a shawl?
'Cause these rhymes are two-hundred proof
They're like anvils lined up on a roof
Waiting to drop on your corny melon
'Cause were not buying what you're selling
First you want to battle then you start to whine
You're looking hungry, it must be snack time
So run home where you feel safe

And no, I didn't retire
I'll snatch you up with the needle-nose pliers

With the ill boat you've never seen before
Glidin' in the glades

Not goofy like Darren or Hazel

Album: Encore- Track 3
Song: I love You More (Kim2)
Still love me? Take This (Clocks gun twice)
You ready? One, two, three! (gun fires twice)
Chorus
Cause the more you, put me through
The more it makes me wanna come back to you
You say you hate me? I just love you more
You don't want me, I just want you more
I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me
I know it's sad but it's making me happy
More that you slap me, more that it turns me on
Cause you love me and I love you more
Verse 1
It's sick but who could ever predict
We be doing the same shit
We say we do it for our baby but we don't
We do it for us it's lust
Cause neither one of us trust each other
So we fuck 'till we bust 'till we cuss each other
Out, we know what it's about SHOUT
Said I throw you out the house,you throw me out the house
I throw you on the couch, punch you in the mouth
Fist fight 'till we turn this mother out
And apologize after laughter pain
It's insane we're back in the same chapter again
And it's sad but it's true, when I'm laying here with you
There ain't nothing anyone could ever say or ever do
Chorus
Verse 2
Cause I hate you do you hate me?
Good cause you're so fucking beautiful when you're angry
It makes me wanna just take you and just throw you
On the bed and fuck you like I don't even know you
You fuck other people and I fuck other people
You're a slut but I'm equal I'm a mutt we're both people
In our ways but neither one of us would ever admit it
Cause one us would have one up on the other so forget it
They can make accusations people spread rumors
But they ain't got proof 'till they do it's just the two of us
It's you and me cause any chick could say that she screwin' me
But you gotta believe me to a degree cause true indeed
If you didn't I wouldn't be hittin' Yeah I would
Cause the sex is too damn good
If I ran who would I run to? It would be this soften womb
So its off and on usually more off then on
But atleast we know that we share this common bond
You're the only one I can fuck without a condom on
I hope the only reason that I cope is cause of that fact
And plus I can bust in that and that's why
Chorus
Verse 3
I can never understand it that's why I don't try
From junior high untill we both die
You silly oh why must we try is it really so rough
That we must always call each other's Billy Goats Gruff
Try to pull each other's legs untill the other begs
We're lying to ourselves that's the beauty of it shit
Cause we truly love each other that's why we're always fight and
All we do is shove each other every other fucking night
And it's clear it ain't gonna change
It's pent up rage we've both had
We both feel like we been up staged by someone else
We've both been someone else's someone else's
problem neither one wants help
It's an addiction and it can't
be fixed
Our family's mixed up, there's a baby sister in the mix
And it hurts cause the pieces to the puzzel don't fit
And anybody who thinks they know us doesn't know shit
And they're probably just tired of hearing it all the time
On every song every lyric and every rhyme
All the hoop-la all the whoopty-woo
What you put me through fucking whoopty-doo
But I won't be made a fool of
If this is true love you wouldn't do what
You did last time you wouldn't screw up
This time cause this time girl I'm telling you what
You do it again I'm fucking you up
No matter what you say
Or what you do
I'm a hunt you down 'till I find you
No matter where you run
I'll be right there right behind you
In your nightmare
So I bought you some flowers
And the candy
All the times that you threw it back at me
So when you hate me you goin' hate me more
When you find out you can't escape me whore

mockingbird,2004,eminem,Hip-Hop,"Yeah
I know sometimes things may not
Always make sense to you right now
But hey,
What daddy always tell you?
Straighten up little soldier
Stiffen up that upper lip
What you crying about?
You got me
Hailie I know you miss your mom and I know you miss your dad
Well I'm gone but I'm trying to give you the life that I never had
I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you want to cry
Cause you're scared, I ain't there?
Daddy's with you in your prayers
No more crying, wipe them tears
Daddy's here, no more nightmares
We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it
Laney uncles crazy, ain't he?
Yeah but he loves you girl and you better know it
We're all we got in this world
When it spins, when it swirls
When it whirls, when it twirls
Two little beautiful girls
Lookin' puzzled, in a daze
I know it's confusing you
Daddy's always on the move, mama's always on the news
I try to keep you sheltered from it but somehow it seems
The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me
All the things growing up his daddy that he had to see
Daddy don't want you to see but you see just as much as he did
We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
But things have gotten so bad between us
I don't see us ever being together ever again
Like we used to be when we were teenagers
But then of course everything always happens for a reason
I guess it was never meant to be
But it's just something we have no control over and that's what destiny is
But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day we'll wake up and this will all just be a dream
Now hush little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise momma's gon' be alright
It's funny
I remember back one year when daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up
And stuck 'em under the tree and said some of 'em were from me
Cause daddy couldn't buy 'em
I'll never forget that Christmas I sat up the whole night crying
Cause daddy felt like a bum, see daddy had a job
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom
And at the time every house that we lived in
Either kept getting broken into and robbed
Or shot up on the block and your mom was saving money for you in a jar
Tryna start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
Almost had a thousand dollars till someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurt so bad it broke your momma's heart
And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart
Mom and dad was arguin' a lot so momma moved back
On the Chalmers in the flat one bedroom apartment
And dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara
And that's when daddy went to California with his CD and met Dr. Dre
And flew you and momma out to see me
But daddy had to work, you and momma had to leave me
Then you started seeing daddy on the T.V. and momma didn't like it
And you and Laney were to young to understand it
Papa was a rollin' stone, momma developed a habit
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand
Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Now I'm sitting in this empty house, just reminiscing
Lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out
To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now
Wow, guess you pretty much are and daddy's still here
Laney I'm talkin' to you too, daddy's still here
I like the sound of that, yeah
It's got a ring to it don't it?
Shh, momma's only gone for the moment
Now hush little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise momma's gon' be alright
And if you ask me too Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
I'mma give you the world
I'mma buy a diamond ring for you
I'mma sing for you
I'll do anything for you to see you smile
And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
I'mma break that birdies neck
I'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
And make him eat every carat don't fuck with dad (ha ha)"
never-enough,2004,eminem,Hip-Hop,"There's not much you could do or say to phase me
People think I'm a little bit crazy
I get it from all angles in a while to save me
To make me stop and think about it 'fore I just say things
Sometimes I forget what other people just may think
A lot of rappers finally wouldn't know how to take me
If they heard some shit, I'd lay the tape 'fore they erase me
I maybe a little too fast paced and racy
Sometimes the average listener rewinds and plays me twenty times
Cause I say so many rhymes, it may seem like I'm goin too fast 'cause my mind is racing
And I could give a fuck what category you place me
Long as when I'm pushing up daisies and gone
As long as you place me amongst one of them greats
When I hit the heavenly gates I'll be cool beside Jay-Z
For every single die hard fan who embraced me
I'm thankful for the talent in which God gave me
And I'm thankful for the environment that he placed me
Believe it or not, I thank my mom for how she raised me
In the neighborhood daily, they jumped and chased me
It only made me what I am today, see
Regardless of what anybody believes who hates me
You ain't gonna make or break me
Tryna strip me of my credibility and make me look fake, G
You're only gonna be in for a rude awakening
Cause sooner or later you haters are all gonna face me
And when you face me with all the shit you've been saving to say to me
You had all this time to think about it
Now don't pussy out and try to wimp out, face me
Cause I've been patiently waiting for the day
That we finally meet in the same place to see
[Chorus: x2]
No matter how many battles I been in and won
No matter how many magazines on my nuts
No matter how many M-C's I end up
Ooh ooh, it's never enough
My flow's untouchable now you gotta face it
Uh oh, it gets worse when I go back to the basics
You go say the wrong shit and get your face split
The smell of victory, love it so much I can taste it
The spot my talk, it blaze a direct hit
Graze it, your peace talk, save it
You shit sounds dated, you're overrated
I'm obligated to study your moves then crush you mutherfuckers
If I'm the best and the worst, then God's gift is a curse
Soldier trained to destroy, you payin' attention boy?
I spit shit, slick shit, so quick you miss it
To be specific I go ballistic as hieroglyphic
My music is a drug, press play, you ain't gotta sniff it
Chew it or pop it, roll a bag of the chocolate
Get your high over and over, but you gotta cop it
When it's hot, it's hot
Your hatin' is undeniable, stop it

Guess who's back
Back again
Shady's back
Tell a friend
Now everyone report to the dance floor
To the dance floor, to the dance floor
Now everyone report to the dance floor
Alright stop
Pajama time
Come here little kiddies, on my lap
Guess who's back with a brand new rap
And I don't mean rap
As in a new case of child molestation accusation
Aah aah aah aah aah
No worries, pappa's got a brand new bag of toys
What else could I possibly do to make noise
I done touched on everything, but little boys
And that's not a stab at Micheal
That's just a metaphor, I'm just psycho
I go a little bit crazy sometimes
I get a little bit out of control with my rhymes
Good god, dip, do a little slide
Bend down, touch your toes and just glide
Up the center of the dance floor
Like T-P for my bung hole and it's cool if you let one go
Nobody's gonna know who'd hear it
Give a little ""poot poot"", it's OK (Fart Sound)
Oops my C-D just skipped
And everyone just heard you let one rip
Now I'm gonna make you dance
It's your chance

Get the top down, let my hair blow
I dunno where I'm goin'
All I know is when I get there
Someones gonna touch my body
Excuse me miss, I don't mean to sound like a jerk
But I'm feelin' just a little stressed out from work
Could you punch me in the stomach and pull my hair
Spit on me, maybe gouge my eyes out, yeah

nobody-s-perfect,2004,eminem,Hip-Hop,"(Eminem)
I really liked you
and you didnt listen
and now I wanan take back everything I said
I wish I were dead
to many things that I did
To many wrongs that i've done
how could I be so stupid
not thinkin of anyone else
just thinkin about me
(chorus)
If you think a while
you will fine out that no one in this world of ours
is perfect
(Eminem)
I shoulda been thinkin about the others around me
who I would be hurtin
who I made mad
who i made sad
I just wish I could take it all back
even at the cost of my lyrics
cant bare it
I need you
Im nothing without you
Im scared of life
I need someone by my side
i dont wanna just sit and hide
(Chorus)
If you think a while
you will fine out that no one in this world of ours
is perfect
Im tired of life
and its bad ride
everyone thats died in Iraq
when the United States were under attack
all the terorism goin on
everyone that been hit by a bomb
(Chorus)(X2)
If you think a while
you will fine out that no one in this world of ours
is perfect."
spend-some-time,2004,eminem,Hip-Hop,"If there's any bitches in this room
Then there's somethin' I gotta say
For all the fools
Who fell for the first
Girl who comes their way
I been down that road, and now I'm back
Sittin' on square one
Tryin' to pick myself up,
Where I started from
I never woulda thought that I'd see you out of control
Even though, my penis was deep down in your hoe
You should know between us we was like mates
Nothing could intervene us especially no hoes
You was more so the shalon type I chose
To more shows, haunted you nights
I suppose that's how it goes,
With time spent emotion grows
In the beginning friends, we decided to roll
So who's responsible when you get excited, explode
And Obie's grinning, then you invite that Obie's cold
But bitches they gon' talk, niggas they gon' hate
We established this way before we became mates
So what's required is that you chill with all that fire
Get your desire when I retire
Spend some time with me
I never thought that I'd find someone to be mine
Lord knows I was right cause you just crossed the line
Spend some time with me
I used to say I never met a girl like you before
Still ain't got a fuckin' clue as to who you truly are
Almost went as far as introducing you to my daughters
'Til you went as far as goin' and snoopin' through my drawers
Now I just feel stupid for the loop that you threw me for
Can't believe I almost flew the coop for some stupid whore
You used to say all you wanted was for me to be yours
All I ever wanted from you was a few booty calls
If you re-call I used to treat you like a groupie broad
When we fucked I refused to even take my jewelery off
But it threw me off the first time I called and you blew me off
It was a shock, it struck me as odd but it turned me on
You started gettin' moody on me pretty soon we'd argue
And the ruder you got, the more beautiful you got to me
And who'd even knew that, who would of even thought possibly
Cupid could shoot another one of them god-damned darts at me
It's true that I got shot in the heart
But when someone seems too good to be true, they usually are
But see, when you're in it, it's to hard to see
'Til you pull up and see some other dudes car parked
And reach up under your seat as your heart starts to beat
Before you make a decision that's life altering
And just as you haul and you turn and you start to leave
You hear them words echoing almost haunting
That taunting ring
Spend some time with me
I never thought that I'd find someone to be mine
Lord knows I was right cause you just crossed the line
Spend some time with me
(Yeah right bitch, Spend time with my dick)
In most cases Stats attitude is fuck a bitch
My only motive is to get head and fuck a bitch
But you was different thought we shared a covenant
Even held your hand in public
We suffering because of this
Shorty on some whole 'nother other shit
Tryin' to play slick, thinkin' I'm gonna trick off rip
I'll admit, I was caught in the mix dyin' to commit
Feed you the best of me I should have fed you piss
We started off closer than close,
But who could have predicted to know your triflin' ways
Would of stopped our growth
And the final result, back in that same boat
I ask myself do I love these hos? Nope!
Em introduced us
Fifty this is Tanya, Tanya this is fifty
Then slid off and left her to kick it with me
I complimented her, I said you had very nice lips
With my imagination, I could see her suckin' my dick
We played the phone game, a week later shit changed fast
Had her comin' over in a cab to give me some ass
Downtown Manhattan on the balcony stare at the skyline
Penthouse full of imported shit, you know how I grind
She got to talkin', talkin' like a opportunist too
Why talk when suckin' my dick is the real career move?
Says she's an inspiring actress she do videos for practice
Yeah, Yeah, now how many times I heard that shit
Spend some time with me
I never thought that I'd find someone to be mine
Lord knows I was right cause you just crossed the line
Spend some time with me"
evil-deeds,2004,eminem,Hip-Hop,"Lord please forgive for what I do
For I know not what I've done.
Father please forgive me for I know not what I do,
I just never had the chance to ever meet You,
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be,
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds
Mama had a baby and its head popped off
(head popped off)
(head popped off)
(head popped off)
(head popped off)
(head popped off)
But mama don't want me the next thing I know I'm gettin' dropped off
(getting dropped off)
(getting dropped off)

(getting dropped off)
Ring, ring, ring on the doorbell of the next door neighbors on their front porch

(Their front porch)
(Their front porch)
(Their front porch)
But they didn't want me neither so they left me on someone else's lawn

Til' someone finally took me in my great aunt and uncle Edna and Charles

(Edna and Charles)

They were the ones who were left in charge

(Sing this song)
(Sing this song)
(Sing this song)
It went a little something like
Mary had a little lamb, little lamb, little lamb,
Debbie had a Satan spawn Satan spawn
Mama why do they keep saying this I just don't understand understand
And by the way where's my dad?!
Father please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds
Predominately, predominately, everything's always predominately
Predominately-white, predominately-black, well what about me?
Where does that leave me?
Well I guess that I'm between predominately both of em'
I think if I hear that fuckin' word again I'm a scream
While I'm projectile vomiting.
What do I look like a Comedian to you?
Do you think that I?m kidding?
What do I look like some kinda idiot?
Wait a minute shit, don?t answer that
Why am I so misunderstood?
Why do I go through so much bullshit
It's such Bullshit it's tush mull bish
Woe is me, there goes poor Marshall again
Whining about his millions
And his mansion and his sorrow he's always drowning in
And the dad that he never had,
And how his childhood was so bad
And how his mom was a dope addict
And his ex-wife how they go at it man
I'd hate to have it as bad as that Mr. Mathers
Claims he had it, I can't imagine it
That little rich poor white bastard
Needs to take some of that cash out of the bank
And take a bath in it
Man if I only had half of it,
Shit if you only knew the half of it?
Father please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds
Evil deeds, while I plant these evil seeds
Please release me from these demons I never
Had any of this shit planned Mom please believe
I don't wanna be Satans spawn, never got the chance to say I'm sorry
Now look at all the pain I caused
Dear Santa-Clause why are you not coming this year again
What did I do that was so bad to deserve this?
Everything could have been So perfect but life ain't a fairy tale.
I'm about to be hoisted up in the air
Forty feet below me there's people everywhere
I don't even know but who feel like they know me 'cause I'm in this Ferris wheel
And all I wanna do is go to the mall and take Hallie on the carousel
Without this crowd everywhere I go but life is like a merry-go-round
Here we go now do-si-do now curtains up the show must go on now
Ring-around-the-rosie the show's over you can all go home now
But the curtain just don't close for me
This ain't how fame was supposed to be
Where's the switch I can just turn off-and-on this ain't what I chose to be
So please God give me the strength
To have what it takes to carry on
'Til I pass 50 back the baton, the camera's on, my soul is gone
Father please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds
Father please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds

one-shot-2-shot,2004,eminem,Hip-Hop,"I told y'all mothafuckas I was comin' back
What now nigga what now what
You's the projects nigga
[Chorus]
One shot two shot three shot four shots
All I hear is gunshots this is where the fun stops
Bodies drop hit the floor music's off
Parties stop, everybody hit the door someone's lickin' shots off
You bitches is gone I'm dropped in the club
And I'm tryna run and get my motherfuckin' gun
(Nigga what about your wife)
Nigga fuck my wife I'm tryna run and save my motherfuckin' life
Oh shit the shoot is comin'
Bitches, hoes niggas is runnin'
People shot all over the floor
And I'm tryna make it to the St. Andrew's door
That's the sound of the glock
Even D-J House fucked around and go shot
I done messed around and forgot my tec
I don't see nobody but Fab Five and Hex
(Kuniva you aight)
These niggas is trippin'
(Where's Bizarre at?)
I'm tryna slip through the exit and get to where my car is at
Bitches screamin' everywhere and niggas is wildin'
Two minutes ago we was all jokin' and smilin'
This chick is clingin' onto me sobbin' and sighin'
Sayin' she didn't mean to diss me earlier and she cryin'
But its real and cats is gettin' killed
So I hugged her and used her body as a human shield
And she got hit now she yellin'
(Don't leave me!)
I told her I'd be right back and the dumb bitch believed me
I squeezed through the back door and made my escape
I ran and got my 38 I hope its not to late
[Chorus]
(Nigga I been tryna call you all day motherfucker where you at?)
I'm on seven mile what the fuck was that
Damn somebody hit me from the back
(With they car?)
With a gat nigga and my tire is flat
And I just hit a pole, them niggas some hoes
(Is you hit?)
I don't know but I can tell you what they drove
It was a black Mitsubishi
(Shit that's the clique we beefin' wit I swear)
Man and I was on my way there
Believe me I'm leavin' a carcus today
I'm a park my car and walk the rest of the way
I'm in the mood to strut, my A-K ain't even tuck
I'm a meet you at the club we goin' fuck these hoes up
[Chorus]
I never seen no shit like this is my life before
People will still camp out from the night before
Sleepin' outside the door waitin' in line
Still tryna get inside the club to see D12 perform
The fire marshals no, the venue's too small
People are wall to wall three thousand and some odd vans
And some come walk from out the parkin' lot
Get into an argument over a parkin' spot
He's about to pull his gun out and let's a few of 'em off
Missed who he's aimin' for six feet away's the door
In St. Andrew's hall not a stray slidin' all over the place
Sprays one bitch in the face another one of 'em came through the wall
Before anyone could even hear the first shot go off
I'm posted up by the bar havin' a Mozeltoff
Bullet wizzed right by my ear damn near shot it off
Thank god I'm alive I gotta find Denaun
And where the fuck is Von he usually tucks one on him
Wait a minute I think I just saw Bizarre
Nah I guess not, what the fuck oh my god it was
I never saw him run so fast in my life
Look at him haulin' ass I think he left his wife
There she is on the ground bein' trampled
I go to grab her up by the damn hand and I can't pull her
God damn there just went another damn bullet I'm hit
My vest is barely able to handle it, its to thin
If I get hit again I can't do it, I scoop deep
Follow Bizarre's path and ran through it
And made it to the front door and collapsed on the steps
Looked up and I seen Swift shootin' it out
But I can't see who he's shootin' it out with
But Denaun's right behind him squeezin' his four fifth
[Chorus]
It's Friday night came to this bitch right
Big ass to my left and Desert Eagle to my right
I ain't come in this bitch to party I came in this bitch to fight
Although I can't stay here to fight 'cause I'm poppin' niggas tonight
That's right bitches I'm drunk with revenge
Shot a bouncer in the neck for tryna check when I get in
Swift told me to meet him here so its clear that this fucker
Shoot out the back of his truck goes up in this motherfucker
So one shot for the money two's to stop the show
Third's for the bartender there's plenty of shots to go
(I just wanna know who's drivin' a black Mitsubishi)
He tried to run so Proof shot him in the knee wit a three piece

You should take a look at the man in

Well he'll always be that Michael to me
And it doesn't matter if he's black or white

At least saying goodbye
So all my people on the left, all my people on the right

Get your ass up for the Doctor, c'mon now!
Here we go, cliffhanger, it's another club banger
Got you hangin' on the edge of your seat, get on down

Too bad, you're off the map now, radar can't even find you
We stay on the grind you slip, we out-grind you
You walk around mad you let your anger blind you
We walk around just playin' the violin behind you
Enough with all the pissin' and moanin', whinin' and bitchin'

Doctor's this, Doctor's that, you got the wrong impression
You must be on the cock of Doc, cause Doc left you all guessin'

We goin' have this motherfucker hoppin in a second (pump pump)
That's why we always save the best cut last

Bye bye!"
big-weenie,2004,eminem,Hip-Hop,"I don't understand
Why are you bein' so mean!?
You're a mean, mean man!
You're just jealous of me
'Cause you, you just can't do what I do
So instead of just admitting it
You walk around and say
All kinds of really mean things about me
'Cause you're a meany, a meany
But it's only cause you're really jealous of me
'Cause I'm what you want to be
'So you just look like a idiot
When you say these mean things
'Cause it's too easy to see
You're really just a big weenie, big weenie
Alright listen, I need you to focus
I need you to go dig deep in your mind, this is important
We are going to perform an experiment of a sort
I'm going to have to ask you to bare with me for a moment
Now I need you to open your mind, your eyes, close em'
You are now about to be placed under my hypnosis
For the next four and a half minutes
We are going to explore into your mind
To find out why you're so fuckin' jealous
Now why do they make you who
Pibbity-cock-a-poo-poo
Syke, I'm kidding I just wanted to see if you're still listening
OK now I need your un-divided attention
Sir I have a question
Why do I always sense this,
Undeniable tension from the moment I enter into the room?
It gets all quiet and whispers
Whenever there's conversations why am I always mentioned?
I been dying to ask, it's been itching at me
Is it just because
You're just jealous of me
Cause you, you just can't do what I do
So instead of just admitting it
You walk around and say
All kinds of really mean things about me
Cause you're a meany, a meany
But it's only cause you're really jealous of me
Cause I'm what you want to be
So you just look like a idiot
When you say these mean things
Cause it's too easy to see
You're really just a big weenie, big weenie
Alright now I, I just flubbed a line
I was going to say something extremely important
But I forgot who or what it was
I fucked up,
Syke, I'm kidding again you idiot, no I didn't
That's just what you wanted to hear from me
Is that I fucked up ain't it?
That I could bust one take
Without lookin' at no paper
It doesn't take a bunch of takes
Or me to stand here in this booth all day
For me to say the truth OK
You're drooling, you have tooth decay
You're mouth is open,
You're disgusting
What the fuck you eat for lunch,
A bunch of sweets or somethin'
What you munch a bunch of crunch-a-munch?
You're tooth is rottin' through the gum
Your breath stinks,
Want to chew some gum?
(Yes I do sir what am I on?)
You sir are on truth serum
[Marshall I'm so jealous of you
Please say you won't tell nobody
I'd be so embarrassed
I'm just absolutely terrified
That someone's gonna find out
Why I'm saying all these terrible, evil, and awful
Mean things, is my own insecurities!
You're just jealous of me
Cause you, you just can't do what I do
So instead of just admitting it
You walk around and say
All kinds of really mean things about me
Cause you're a meany, a meany
But it's only cause you're just really jealous of me
Cause I'm what you want to be
So you just look like a idiot
When you say these mean things
Cause it's too easy to see
You're really just a big weenie, big weenie
Alright now we, we're going to conduct
That experiment that we were talking about earlier
Just to see what a frog looks like
When he takes two hits of ecstasy
'Cause that's exactly what your eyes look like
Want to check to see? Here's a mirror
Notice the resemblance here?
Wait let me put these sun glasses on
Now look in this mirror, how bout' now
What do you have in common?
You're both green with envy and look like idiots with sunglasses on em'
You look like I sound like, singing about weenies
Now take my weenie out of your mouth
This is between me and you
I know you're not happy,
I know you'd much rather see me lying
In the corner of a room somewhere crying
Curled up in a ball, tweaked out of my mind dying
There's no denying
That my weenie is much bigger than yours is
Mine is like stickin' a banana between 2 oranges
Why are you even doin' this to yourself?
It's pointless,
Why do we have to keep on going through this?
This is torturous
My point is this, that if you say mean things,
You're weenie will shrink
Now I forgot what the chorus is, you're just a
You're just jealous of me
'Cause you, you just can't do what I do
So instead of just admitting it
You walk around and say
All kinds of really mean things about me
'Cause you're a meany, a meany
But it's only cause you're just really jealous of me
Cause I'm what you want to be
So you just look like a idiot
When you say these mean things
'Cause it's too easy to see
You're really just a big weenie, big weenie
Fuck off my dick"
crazy-in-love,2004,eminem,Hip-Hop,"Tell myself that I was doin' all right
There's nothin' left to do tonight
But go crazy on you
Crazy on you
Let me go crazy, crazy on you, oh
Can't you see what you do to me baby,
You make me crazy, you make me act like a maniac
I'm like a lunatic, you make me sick
You're truly the only one who can do this to me
You just make me get so crazy
I go schizo, I get so insane I just go schizophrenic
One minute I want to slit your throat the next I want to sex
You make me crazy
The way we act like two maniacs in the sack
We fuck like two jack rabbits and maybe that's a bad habit
'Cause the next day we right back at it
In the same exact pattern
What the fuck is the matter with us
We can't figure out if it's lust
Or it's love which that is attractin' us to each other
They say that every man grows up to marry his own mother
Which would explain why you're such a motherfuckin' bitch
But I stay and still stick it out with you
Even though I just hit you today but you deserved it
You hit me first and provoked me to choke you
Just 'cause I came home late last night
Crawled in bed and I woke you
But if there's one thing about you that I admire
It's baby, because you stay with me
Maybe 'cause you're as crazy as I am
'Cause when I look at you
I can see an angel in your eyes but if I look deeper inside
I see a freakish little side, like a devil in disguise
You're always full of surprises
Always pullin' devices out your purse, little vibrators and dildos
You fucked yourself so much you barely feel those anymore
You're only twenty four but you're plenty more mature
Than those other little hoes who just act like little girls
Like they're in middle school still you're crazy, sexy, cool
Chill you play your position you never step out of line
Even though I stay in your business
You've always kept out of mine
I wonder what's on your mind
Sometimes they say love is blind
Maybe that's why the first time I dotted your eye
You didn't see the sign
Or maybe you did maybe you like being shoved
Maybe cause we're crazy in love
Let me go crazy on you
Crazy on you
Let me go crazy, crazy on you, oh
You are the ink to my paper
What my pen is to my my pad
The moral, the very fiber
The whole substance to my rap
You are my reason for being
The meaning of my existence
If it wasn't for you I would never be able to spit this
As intense as I do, and the irony
Is you rely on me as much
As I rely on you to inspire me like you do
You provide me the lighter fluid the fuel to my fire
You're my entire supply of gas, the match and igniter
The only way that I'm able to stay so stable
Is you're the legs to my table,
If you were to break I'd fall on my face
But I'm always gonna make you feel
I don't need you as much as I really need you
So you don't use it to your advantage
But you're essential to me
You're the air I breathe
I believe if you ever leave me
I'd probably have no reason to be
You are the Kim to my Marshall
You're the Slim to my Shady
The Dre to my Eminem
The Alana to my Hailie
You are the word that I'm lookin for
When I'm tryin' to describe how I feel inside
And the right one just won't come to my mind
You're like the pillar that props me up
The beam that supports me
The bitch who never took half
The wife who never divorced me
You're like the root to my evil
You let my devil come out me
You let me beat the shit out you before you beat the shit out me
And no matter how much too much is never enough
Maybe 'cause we're crazy in love
Let me go crazy on you
Crazy on you
Let me go Crazy, crazy on you oh"

yellow-brick-road,2004,eminem,Hip-Hop,"What we have to do is deal with it
When these individuals are young enough
If you will, to be saved, not in a religious sense
But not to constitute what this country at times calls if or which over
We seem to be approaching an age of the gross
We all have this idea that we should
Move up a little bit from our parents station
And each generation should do a little bit better
Alright, come on let's cut the bullshit enough let's get it started
Let's start addressing this issue and open it up
Let's take this shit back to basement and we can discuss statements
Thats made on this tape and its whole original
The music that we all know and love
The music we all enjoy the music you all accuse me of try na destroy
Let's rewind it to '89 when I was a boy on the east side of Detroit
Crossin' 8 mile into Warren into hick territory I'd like to share a story
This is my story and you cant nobody tell it for me
You have well informed me and I am well aware that I don't belong here
You've made that perfectly clear I get my ass kicked
Damn near everywhere from Bel-air shopping center
Just for stopping in there from the black side
All the way to the white side
Okay there's a bright side, a day that I might slide
You may call it a past I call it haulin' my ass
Through that patch of grass over them railroad tracks
Oh them railroad tracks them old railroad tracks
Them good old notorious oh well known tracks

Come on, let's go back
Follow the yellow brick road as we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
That I once used to call home sweet home
I'd roam the streets so much they call me a drifter
Sometimes I stick up a thumb just to hitch hike
Just to get picked up to get me a lift to 8 mile and Van Dyke
And steal a god damn bike from somebody's backyard
And drop it off at the park that was the halfway mark
To meet Kim had to walk back to her Mamma's on Chalmers after dark
To sneak me in the house when I'm kicked out my Mom's
Thats about the time I first met Proof n' Goofy Gary on the steps
At Osborne handin' out some flyers
He was doin' some talent shows at centerline high
I told him to stop by and check us out sometime
He looked at me like I'm out my mind
Shook his head like white boys don't know how to rhyme
I spit out a line and rhymed birthday with first place
And we both had the same rhymes that sound alike
We was on the same shit that big Daddy Kane shit
With compound syllables sound combined
From that day we was down to ride
Somehow we knew we'd meet again somewhere down the line

My first year in 9th grade, can't forget that day at school
It was cool till your man M C Sham came through
And said that pumas the brand 'cuz the clan makes troops
It was rumors but man god damned they flew
Must a been true because man we done banned they shoes
I had the new ones the cool J, ice land, swayed too
And we just through them in the trash like they yesterday's news
Guess who came through next, X Clan debut
Professor X and glorious exists in a state of red, black, and green
With a key sissies now with this bein' a new trend
We don't fit in crack as is out with cactus albums
Blackness is in, African symbols and medallions
Represents black power and we ain't know what it meant
Me and my man Howard and butter would go to the mall with 'em
All over our necks like we're showin 'em off not knowin' at all
We was bein' laughed at you ain't even half black
You ain't posed to have that homie let me grab that
And that flavor flave clock we gon' have to snatch that
All I remember is meetin' back at Manx's basement
Sayin' how we hate this, how racist but dope the X Clan take this
Which reminds me back in '89 me and Kim broke up for the first time
She was try na two time me and there was this black girl
At our school who thought I was cool
'Cuz I rapped so she was kinda eying me
And oh the irony guess what her name was ain't even gon' say it plus
The same color hair as hers was and blue contacts and a pair of jugs
The bombest god damn girl in our whole school if I could pull it
Not only would I become more popular
But I would be able to piss Kim off at the same time
But it backfired I was supposed to dump her
But she dumped me for this black guy
And that's the last I ever seen or heard
Or spoke to the oh foolish pride girl
But I've heard people say they heard the tape and it ain't that bad
But it was I singled out a whole race and for that apologize
I was wrong 'cuz no matter what color a girl is she still a

ricky-ticky-toc,2004,eminem,Hip-Hop,"Once you call my name out
Things will never be the same
They should have never let us
Get off foot in this game
Ever since I was introduced to rap music
I been missin' a screw like Bishop and Juice
I could lose it at any moment
Those who know me know it
So they probaly told you go with the flow
Just so that I don't explode and
Have another episode where I let it go
As far as the one with Benzino did
I'm waitin' for that next beef
I'm cocked, locked and loaded
I'm ready to go so bad I'm goin' bananas

Use it to fuckin' pole vault with
Oh, shit! I mean when she was still bloated
Before they cut her stomach open and lypo'ed it
Anybody I throw flames at gets a name, it's a game
'Cause they know that they don't spit the same
It's a shame what people do for ten minutes of fame
Everyday, it's the same thing
People in this game try to buddy, buddy us
Just to get close enough to study us
Everybody just wants to have somethin' to do with that
They all tryin' to get that stamp
They after that Shady, aftermath money
It's like a monopoly
They probably just now finally
Understand how to rob fully
50 Cent was like a fuckin' jackpot for me
And Dre, it's like we hit the fuckin' lottery
And a damn slot machine at the same time as each other
Why the fuck you think we ride like we brothers
When we rhyme with each other?
In time we discovered that we have more in common
Then we thought with each other
Both robbed of our mothers
Our fathers ain't want us
What was wrong with us, was it our fault
'Cause we started thinkin' God doesn't love us
Two odd motherfuckers
Who just happened to meet at the right time
What a coincidence 'cause when 50 got shot up in Jamaica Queens
I still remember the call up at Chung King 'cause
Big L had just got popped just a month before
If 50 lives, he's gettin' dropped from Columbia
Two years later me and Doc had to come and operate
That's when he popped up a number one
And we ain't never gonna stop if you wonderin'
Even if I'm under the gun
You ain't gotta agree all the time with me
Or see eye to eye
There'll always be animosity between you and I
But see the difference is if it is I could give a shit
Still gonna conduct motherfuckin' business as usual
Ego's aside 'fore I bruise 'em all
Swallow your pride 'fore I step on it with shoes you call
Nike's, Earthlings, how do you like these?
You gotta love 'em, look at the bottom of 'em, they're like cleats
Stompin', I been rompin'
Since Tim Dogg was hollerin' 'Fuck Compton'
I was whilin', freestylin'
Back when they was still makin' Maxell cassettes
I wasn't even raps Elvis yet

We never win but the battle wages on for toy soldiers
I'm suppose to be the soldier, who never blows his composure
Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders
I ain't never suppose to show it, my crew ain't suppose to know it
Even if it means going toe to toe with the Benzino, it don't matter
I never drag 'em in battles that I can handle less I absolutely have to

I'm so caught it I almost feel like I'm the one who caused it
This ain't what I'm in Hip Hop for, it's not why I got in it
That was never my object for someone to get killed
Why would I want to destroy something I helped build
It wasn't my intentions, my intentions were good
I went through my whole career with out ever mentioning
And that's just outta respect, for not running my mouth
And talking about something that I knew nothing about
Plus Dre told me stay out, just wasn't my beef, So I did
I just fell back, watched and gritted my teeth while he's all over TV
Now I'm talking a man who literally saved my life, like fuck it
I understand, this is business and this shit just isn't none of my business
But still knowing this shit could pop off at any minute cause
Step by step, heart to heart, left right left
We all fall down, like toy soldiers
Bit by bit, torn apart
We never win but the battle wages on for toy soldiers
It used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme
And wouldn't have to worry about one of your people dying
But now it's elevated cause once you put someone's kids in it
Shit gets escalated, it ain't just words no more, is it
It's a different ball game, call names and you ain't just rapping
We actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happening
Me and Dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him
And asked him not to start it, he wasn't gonna go after him
Until Ja' start yappin' in magazines how he stabbed him
Fuck 'em 50, smash him, mash him, and let him have it
Meanwhile my intentions pulled me in other directions
Some receptionist said the source who answers phones at his desk
Has an erection for me and thinks
That I'll be his resurrection
Tries to blow the dust of his mic and make a new record
But now he's fucked the game up cause one of the ways I came up
Was through that publication, the same one that made me famous
Now the owner of it got a grudge against me for nothing but fuck it
That motherfucker can get it too, fuck 'em then
But I'm so busy being pissed off, I don't stop to think
That we just inherited 50's beef with Murder Inc
And he's inherited mine, which is fine, ain't like either of us mind
We still have soldiers that's on the front line that's willing to die for us
As soon as we give the orders, never to extort us
Strictly to show they support us
Maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in a chorus to show we love 'em back
And to let 'em know how important it is to have Runyon Avenue soldiers up in our corners
Their loyalty to us is worth more then any award is
But I ain't trying to have none of my people hurt or murdered
It ain't worth it, I can't think of a perfecter way to word it
Then to just say that I love y'all too much to see the verdict
I'll walk away from it all before I'll let it go any further
But don't get it twisted, it's not a plea that I'm coping
I'm just willing to be the bigger man
If y'all can quit popping off at the jaws with the knocking
'Cause frankly I'm sick of talking
I'm not gonna let someone else's coffin rest on my conscience 'cause"
mosh,2004,eminem,Hip-Hop,"I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America
And to the Republic for which it stands
One nation under God
Indivisible?
It feels so good to be back
I scrutinize every word, memorize every line
I spit it once, refuel re-energize and rewind
I give sight to the blind, my insight through the mind
I exercise my right to express when I feel it's time
It's just all in your mind, what you interpret it as
I say to fight, you take it as I'm a whip someone's ass
If you don't understand, don't even bother to ask
A father who has grown up with a fatherless past
Who has blown up now to rap phenomenon that has
Or at least shows no difficulty multi-task
And in juggling both perhaps mastered his craft
Slash entrepreneur who has held onto few more rap acts
Who's had a few obstacles thrown his way through the last half
Of his career typical manure moving past that
Mr. kisses ass crack, he's a class act
Rubber band man, yea he just snaps back
Come along follow me as I lead through the darkness
As I provide just enough spark that we need to proceed
Carry on, give me hope, give me strength
Come with me and I won't steer you wrong
Put your faith and your trust as I guide us through the fog
To the light at the end of the tunnel
We gonna fight, we gonna charge, we gonna stomp, we gonna march
Through the swamp, we gonna mosh through the marsh
Take us right through the doors (c'mon)
All the people up top on the side and the middle
Come together lets all form and swamp just a little
Just let it gradually build from the front to the back
All you can see is a sea of people some white and some black
Don't matter what color, all that matters we gathered together
To celebrate for the same cause don't matter the weather
If it rains let it rain, yea the wetter the better
They ain't gonna stop us they can't, we stronger now more than ever
They tell us no we say yea, they tell us stop we say go
Rebel with a rebel yell, raise hell we gonna let em know
Stomp, push, shove, mush, Fuck Bush, until they bring our troops home (c'mon)
Come along follow me as I lead through the darkness
As I provide just enough spark that we need to proceed
Carry on, give me hope, give me strength
Come with me and I won't steer you wrong
Put your faith and your trust as I guide us through the fog
To the light at the end of the tunnel
We gonna fight, we gonna charge, we gonna stomp, we gonna march
Through the swamp, we gonna mosh through the marsh
Take us right through the doors (c'mon)
Imagine it pouring, it's raining down on us
Mosh pits outside the oval office
Someone's tryna tell us something,
Maybe this is god just sayin' we're responsible
For this monster, this coward,
That we have empowered
This is bin Laden, look at his head noddin'
How could we allow something like this without pumping our fists
Now this is our final hour
Let me be the voice in your strength and your choice
Let me simplify the rhyme just to amplify the noise
Try to amplify the times it, and multiply by six
Teen million people, Are equal at this high pitch
Maybe we can reach Al-Queda through my speech
Let the president answer a higher anarchy
Strap him with an Ak-forty seven, let him go, fight his own war
Let him impress daddy that way
No more blood for oil, we got our own battles to fight on our own soil
No more psychological warfare, to trick us to thinking that we ain't loyal
If we don't serve our own country, we're patronizing a hero
Look in his eyes its all lies
The stars and stripes, they've been swiped, washed out and wiped
And replaced with his own face, Mosh now or die
If I get sniped tonight you know why,
'Cause I told you to fight.
Come along follow me as I lead through the darkness
As I provide just enough spark that we need to proceed
Carry on, give me hope, give me strength
Come with me and I won't steer you wrong
Put your faith and your trust as I guide us through the fog
To the light at the end of the tunnel
We gonna fight, we gonna charge, we gonna stomp, we gonna march
Through the swamp, we gonna mosh through the marsh
Take us right through the doors (c'mon)
And as we proceed,
To Mosh through this desert storm,
In these closing statements, if they should argue
Let us beg to differ
As we set aside our differences
And assemble our own army
To disarm this Weapon of Mass Destruction
That we call our President, for the present
And Mosh for the future of our next generation
To speak and be heard
Mr. President, Mr. Senator?
Do you guy's hear us? hear us? (Hailie)"
rain-man,2004,eminem,Hip-Hop,"Dre (Em)
Yeah, definitely, definitely dope.
Definitely, K-Mart.
Yeah, yeah
You find me offensive? I find you offensive
For finding me offensive
Hence if I should draw the line any fences
If so to what extent if at
Any, should I go? 'Cause it's getting expensive
Being on the other side of the courtroom on the defensive
They say I cause extensive
Psychological nerve damage to the brain when I go to lengths this,
Far at other people's expenses
I say your all just too goddamn sensitive
It's censorship
And it's down right blasphemous
Let's end this shit now cause I won't stand for this
And Christopher Reeves won't sit for this neither
And let's clear this up too I ain't got no beef with him either
He used to be like a hero to me
I even believe I, had one of those 25 cent stickers on my refrigerator
Right next to Darth Vader
And Darth must have put a hex on him for later
I feel like it's my fault cause of the way that
I stuck him up in between him and Lex Luther
I killed Superman, I killed super-man
Man how ironic, that I'd be the bad guy
Kryptonite the green chronic
'Cause I ain't got no legs!
Or no brain, nice to meet you
Hi, my name is,
I forgot my name!
My name was not to become what I became with this level of fame
My soul is possessed by this devil my new name is,
Rain man
Now in the Bible it says
Thou shall not watch two lesbians in bed,
Have homosexual sex
Unless of course you were given the consent to join in
Then of course, it's intercourse
And it's bisexual sex
Which isn't as bad, as long as you show some remorse for your actions
Either before, during or after performing the act of that which
Is normally referred to as such, more commonly known phrases
That are more used by today's kids
In a more derogatory way but
But who's to say, what's fair to say, and what not to say?
Let's ask Dr. Dre
Dr. Dre? (What up?)
I gotta question if I may? (Yeah)
Is it gay to play Putt-Putt golf with a friend (Yeah)
And watch his butt-butt when he tees off? (Yeah)
But, up, I ain't done yet
In football the quarterback yells out hutt-hutt
While he reaches in another grown man's ass
Grabs on his nuts but just what if
It was never meant it was just an accident
But he tripped, fell, slipped and his penis went in
His teeny tiny little round hiney and he didn't mean it
But his little weenie flinched just a little bit
And I don't need to go in into any more details but
What if he pictured it as a females butt?
Is that gay? I just need to clear things up
'Til then I'll just walk around with a manly strut because
'Cause I ain't got no legs!
Or no brain, nice to meet you
Hi, my name is,
I forgot my name!
My name was not to become what I became with this level of fame
My soul is possessed by this devil my new name is,
Rain man
You find me offensive, I find you offensive
Shit, this is the same verse I just did this
When am I gonna come to my good senses?
Probably the day Bush comes to my defenses
My spider sense is telling me Spiderman is nearby
And my plan is to get him next
And open up a whip ass canister
Goddamn it Dre where's the goddamn beat? (Yeah)
Anyway, anyway I don't know how else to put it
This is the only thing that I'm good at
I am the bad guy, Kryptonite the green chronic
Demonic, yep yep, don't worry I'm on it
I got it, high fived Nick Lachey
Stuck a pen in Jessica's head and walked away
And she blew around the room like a balloon
I grabbed the last can of chicken tuna
Out the trash can and zoom I
Headed straight back to the Neverland Ranch
With a peanut butter, jelly, chicken, tuna sandwich
And I ain't even gotta make no goddamn sense
I just did a whole song and I didn't say shit
'Cause I ain't got no legs!
Or no brain, nice to meet you
Hi, my name is,
I forgot my name!
My name was not to become what I became with this level of fame
My soul is possessed by this devil my new name is,

puke,2004,eminem,Hip-Hop,"There I go, thinkin' of you again
You don't know how sick you make me
You make me fuckin' sick to my stomach
Every time I think of you I puke
You must just not know
You may not think you do but you do
Every time I think of you I puke
I was gonna take the time to sit down
And write you a little poem
But off of the dome it would probably be a little more
More suitable for this type of song
I got a million reasons off the top of my head
That I could think of
16 bars just ain't enough to put some ink to
So fuck it I'm a start right here and just be brief
About to rattle off some other reasons
I knew I shouldn't go and get another tattoo
Of you on my arm, but what do I go and do?
I go and get another one, now I got two
Now I'm sittin' here with your name on my skin
I can't believe I went and did this stupid shit again
My next girlfriend, now her names gotta be Kim shit
If you only knew how much I hated you
For every motherfucking thing you ever put us through
Then I wouldn't be standin' here cryin' over you boohoo
You don't know how sick you make me
You make me fuckin' sick to my stomach
Every time I think of you I puke
You must just not know
You may not think you do but you do
Every time I think of you I puke
I was gonna take the time to sit down
And write you a little letter
But I thought a song would probably be a little better
Instead of a letter, that you'd probably just shred up, yea
I stumbled on your picture yesterday and made me stop and think of
How much of a waste it'd be for me to put some ink to
A stupid piece of paper, I'd rather let you see how
Much I fuckin' hate you in a freestyle
You're a fuckin' coke-head and I hope you fuckin' die
I hope you get to hell and Satan sticks a needle in your eye
I hate your fuckin' guts you fuckin' slut I hope you die, die
But please don't get me wrong, I'm not bitter or mad
It's not that I still love you its not cause I want you back
It's just that when I think of you it makes me want to yack, yack
But what else can I do, I haven't got a clue
Now I guess I'll just move on I have no choice but to
But every time I think of you now all I want to do is puke
You don't know how sick you make me
You make me fuckin' sick to my stomach
Every time I think of you I puke
You must just not know
You may not think you do but you do
Every time I think of you I puke"
one-last-time,2004,eminem,Hip-Hop,"Sometimes its hard to wake up in the morning
Mind full of demons, I don't wanna hear them anymore
Got me heartbroken,fine, so many babies screaming
Cause they seeing destruction before they a see human being
So they start smoking weed, we'll never get our day
Until we learn to pray, keep our families in shape
Cause they all broke. and why do ghetto birds die
Before we learn to fly, some bodies else's child caught in guns
Smoking weed, can all make a change
So I'm told, but I haven't seen the change unfold,
I keep hoping please, if you prefer to breathe,
Communities in need of people that will lead
Keep your eyes open, I can only say I'll try
Until the day I die, I promise to be wise
With my heart open, greed, brings only misery
A way to tragedy, so I stay sucker free
Only a few chosen, rise (rise)
My ghetto queen, rise (rise)
Don't be afraid to try (try)
Too many of us died to the door to open wide
My brother be wise, stay focused on the prize
Though everybody dies
We can
Only learn to take, our anger and our hate
Control our mental state, settle down, and just set it straight
Maybe we can learn to take a second to pump the brakes
For we said it, regret it later, and let it escalate
Cause by then its too just late, theres so much we can take
Theres only so much someone can swallow and tolerate
To the point that he just breaks, snaps and thats all it takes
You'd think that we was learning from other rappers mistakes
But we aint
Its plain to go against, with every artists, comes the image he portrays
And a picture that he paints
But in the midst of all this anger and this angst
Never once did you hear me say I'm a gangster and I aint hear no complaints
But I know, that I will always continue to grow,
As long as I lead and never follow no one else's shadow
There will never be another me
And that I can guarantee
Thats why the f*** I remain sucker free to this day
The game will never be the same
No matter how much fame or success they attain
There will never be another me
And no matter what they do
There will never be another you
You can search but you'll never find
You can try to rewind time
But in your hearts and your minds
We will never die
We are forever alive
And we continue growing
One day at a time
Don't be caught in the publicity and caught in the hype
Rappers are regular people minus money and light
Searching for fortune and fame, and super stardom
All the jewelry, all the cars, whose crew is the hardest.
Now the hip-hop police, the villains is watching
And kids think beef is the only option
Outlaws born filthy, guilty as charged
My memories of Khaddafi, but Makaveli lives on
You think the industry is fun
And no pity with guns
And when your money is up
Thats when your enemies come
So if he died and came back
Would he try to save rap?
We needing a change, the drama remains
I spent my whole life, fighting myself
That I cant win so I'm inviting some help
and every now and then I take rights from left
Im still just like a kid, looking for stripes on my belt
And that there is a fight in itself
So I just pray and hope god
Take a like to myself
No matter how much I try (stay alive)
I'm gunna die mad, still standing there in love with my pride
Heard frivolous beats, we past that
I'm trying to keep some income coming in
And collect on my a** cap
The rappers in the game aint changed
And I finally realized that we not in the same game
The hating will never end, so I guess I'll deal wit it
Them 4-5 with cop killers, just some steel wit it
The streets is military, you gotta be a soldier
Gotta stay leery and keep your eyes on the rollers
As they do what they gotta do to shackle and hold us
So we gotta do what we gotta do to keep rolling
One way at a time, keep the faith in your mind
and we continue growin
One day at a time. Damn!"
my-1st-single,2004,eminem,Hip-Hop,"Oh! Yeah,
So much for 1st single on this one
Shady's the label, Aftermath is the stable
That the horses come out of 'erp
Of course we're about to stir up
Some shit thick as Mrs. Butterworth's syrup
It's the Mr. Picked-On-Christopher-Reeves-Just-For-No-Reason
Other than to just tease him
'Cause he was his biggest (burp) fan
He used to be Superman
Now I'm pourin' liquor on the curb in his name for him
""Eminem you wait til we meet up again
Fucker I'm kicking your ass for everything you've ever said""
It goes one for the money two for the fuckin' show
Ready get set let's go
Here comes the buckin' bronco
Stompin' and stampedin' up the damn street like them buffalo
Soldiers I told ya
I'm about to blow so look out below, Geronimo
Motherfuckers it's dominoes
I'm on a roll, around and around I go
When will I stop? I don't know
Tryin' to pick up where the Eminem Show left off but I know
Anything's possible though I'm not gonna top what I sold
I'm at the top of my game that shit is not gonna change
Long as I got Dr Dre on my team I'll get away
With murder, I'm like O-J
He's like my Cochran today
We keep them Mark Ferman tapes in a safe
Lock em away
Better watch what you say just when you thought you were safe
Them fuckers got you on tape
You swear to God you was playin'
Whether or not you was little Joshua Gosh
I wish I could of told you not to do the same
'Cause one day it could cost you your name

And this was supposed to be my first single (burp)
But I just fucked that off so
Fuck it let's all have fun, let's mingle (burp)
Slap a bitch and smack a ho
This was supposed to be my catchy little jingle (fart)
That you hear on your radio
But shit's about to hit the shingle (fart)
Oh oh oh oh oh oh no
Oh ah oh ah oh ah
Oh oh ah ah
Oh ah oh ah oh ah
Poo poo ka ka

Sleeping pills, and woke up in bed next to his best friend Derrick bare-naked
Jig-a-jig-ji-ji-Janean just turned sixteen and used a fake I-D
To sneak in V-I-P to see are Kelly
Hee-hee-hee-hee
To be so young and naive
Oh what I wouldn't give to live so Kim and care free
Paris and Nicky's parents must be so tickled they cherish every picture
With their kids with hickeys all over their necks
Hicky-dickory dirk diggler look at me work wizardry
With these words, am I a jerk or just jerk chicken?
Or (scratch sound) jerkin your chain
Twenty two jerks in a jerk circle
Or is it a circle jerk
Or wait a minute what am I saying?
Allow me to run it back and rewind it
Wait let me ask you again
Am I just jerkin your chain
Am I berserk or insane
Or am I just one of them damn amateurs
Working the dang cameras
Filmin' one of them Paris Hilton homemade
Porno's who keeps tiltin' the lens at an angle
Jigga-ji-just recently somebody just discovered Britney and Justin
Video tapes of em fuckin'
When they was just Musketeers in the Mickey Mouse Club and dusted em
And went straight to The Source with em
Cause they could have sworn someone said ni-
And then tried to erase and record over it
But if you listen close enough to it
You can hear the ga-uh
And then come ta
Find out it was Justin
Sayin' ""I'm gon-na cum!""
And this was supposed to be
[Chorus]
Any opinions or somethin' you just wanna get off your chest
And address it about my lyrics
I'd love to hear it
All you gotta do is pick up the phone and just dial up this number
It's 1-800 I'm a dick sucker I love to suck a dick
And if someone picks up you can talk all the shit you want about me
Just type in your number back and follow it by the pound key
And I'll be sure to get back as soon as there comes a day
That I fall out with Dre
Wake up gay and make up with Ray
Hey! So fuck a chicken, lick a chicken, suck a chicken, beat a chicken
Eat a chicken like it's a big cock, big a big cock
Or suck a dick and lick a dick and eat a dick and stick a dick in your mouth
I'm done you can fuck off
Fuck a fuck off

There she goes shaking that ass on the floor
Bumpin' and grindin' that pole
The way she's grindin' that pole, I think I'm losing control
Get buzzed, get drunk, get crunked, get fucked up
Hit the strip club don't forget once get your dick rubbed
Get fucked, get sucked, get wasted, shit faceted
Pasted, blasted, puke drink up, get a new drink
Hit the bathroom sink, throw up
Wipe your shoe clean, got a routine
Knowin' still got a few chunks on your shoestring
Knowin' I was dehydrated till the beat vibrated
I was revibed as soon as this bitch is gyrated
And hips and licked them lips and that was it
I had to get Nate Dogg and his sing some shit
Two to the one from the one to the three
I like good pussy and I like good trees
Smoke so much weed you wouldn't believe
And I get more ass than a toilet seat
Three to the one from the one to the three
I met a bad bitch last night in the D
Let me tell you how I made her leave with me
Conversation and Hennessey
I've been to the muthafuckin' mountain top
Heard muthafuckers talk, seen and dropped
If I ain't got a weapon I'm a pick up a rock
And when I bust yo ass I'm a continue to rock
Getcha ass of the wall with your two left feet
It's real easy just follow the beat
Don't let that fine girl pass you by
Look real close cause strobe lights lie
We 'bout to have a party (turn the music up)

Come on girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Oh girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Come on girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me

Open your mouth for about four or five minutes
Take a little bit of this fluoride with it
Swish but don't spit it, swallow and I'll finish
Yeah me and Nate d-o double g
Looking for a couple bitches with some double d's
Pop a little champagne and a couple E's

I'm lookin' for a girl I can fuck in my hummer truck

Knows that she can say no but she won't say no
Now look at this lady all in front of me, sexy as can be
Tonight I want a slut, will you be mine?
I heard you was freaky from a friend of mine
Now I hope you don't get mad at me
But I told Nate you was a freak
He said he wants a slut, hope you don't mind

stan,2005,eminem,Hip-Hop,"My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray
Put your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad
It's not so bad
My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray
Put your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad
It's not so bad
Dear Slim, I wrote you but still ain't callin'
I left my cell, my pager, and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not-a got 'em
There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin'
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
But anyways, fuck it, what's been up? Man how's your daughter?
My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm bout to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I'm a call her?
I'm a name her Bonnie
I read about your Uncle Ronnie too I'm sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
I know you probably hear this everyday, but I'm your biggest fan
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures man
I like the shit you did with Rawkus too, that shit was fat
Anyways, I hope you get this man, hit me back,
Just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan
This is Stan
My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray
Put your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad
It's not so bad
Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance
I ain't mad, I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans
If you didn't wanna talk to me outside your concert
You didn't have to, but you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew
That's my little brother man, he's only six years old
We waited in the blistering cold for you,
For four hours and you just said, ""No.""
That's pretty shitty man, you're like his fuckin' idol
He wants to be just like you man, he likes you more than I do
I ain't that mad though, I just don't like bein' lied to
Remember when we met in Denver, you said if I'd write you you would write back
See I'm just like you in a way
I never knew my father neither
He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
I can relate to what you're saying in your songs
So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on
'Cause I don't really got shit else so that shit helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo of your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
See everything you say is real, and I respect you cause you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk about you 24/7
But she don't know you like I know you Slim, no one does
She don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up, you gotta call me man
I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
Sincerely yours, Stan, P.S. we should be together too
My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray
Put your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad
It's not so bad
Dear Mister ""I'm Too Good To Call Or Write My Fans""
This will be the last package I ever send your ass
It's been six months and still no word, I don't deserve it?
I know you got my last two letters, I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
So this is my cassette I'm sending you, I hope you hear it
I'm in the car right now, I'm doing 90 on the freeway
Hey Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka
You dare me to drive?
You know the song by Phil Collins, ""In the Air of the Night""
About that guy who could a saved that other guy from drowning
But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a a show he found him?
That's kinda how this is, you could a rescued me from drowning
Now it's too late, I'm on a thousand downers now, I'm drowsy
And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall
I love you Slim, we coulda been together, think about it
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it
I hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me
See Slim, shut up bitch! I'm tryin' to talk!
Hey Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk
But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up, see I ain't like you
'Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more, and then she'll die too
Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now
Oh shit, I forgot, how am I supposed to send this shit out?
My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray
Put your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad
It's not so bad
Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner but I just been busy
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?
Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
And here's an autograph for your brother
I wrote it on the Starter cap
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I must of missed you
Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?
I say that shit just clownin' dog, come on, how fucked up is you?
You got some issues Stan, I think you need some counseling
To help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some
And what's this shit about us meant to be together?
That type of shit will make me not want us to meet each other
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
Or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time
Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin' just fine
If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you but Stan
Why are you so mad? Try to understand, that I do want you as a fan
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
And had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid
And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to
Come to think about, his name was, it was you
Damn!"
when-i-m-gone,2005,eminem,Hip-Hop,"Yo, it's my life, my own words I guess
Have you ever loved someone so much
You'd give an arm for
Not the expression, no
Literally give an arm for
When they know they're your heart
And you know you are their armor
And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her
But what happens when karma
Turns right around and bites you
And everything you stand for turns on you to spite you
What happens when you become the main source of her pain
""Daddy look what I made""
""Dad's gotta go catch a plane""
""Daddy where's mommy?
I can't find mommy, where is she?""
""I don't know, go play, Hailie baby, your daddy's busy
Daddy's writing a song, this song ain't gon write itself""
I give you one underdog, and you gotta swing by yourself
Then turn right around in that song and tell her you love her
And put hands on her mother who's the spittin' image of her
That's Slim Shady, yeah baby Slim Shady's crazy
Shady made me
But tonight, Shady's rock-a-bye baby
And when I'm gone just carry on don't mourn,
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that,
I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing so baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back
And when I'm gone just carry on don't mourn,
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that,
I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing so baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back
I keep havin' this dream,
I'm pushin' Hailie on a swing, she keeps screamin', she don't want me to sing
""You're makin' mommy cry, why, why is mommy cryin'""
""Baby, daddy ain't leavin' no more, Daddy you're lyin'
You always say that, you always say this is the last time
But you ain't leavin' no more daddy, you're mine""
She's pilin' boxes in front of the door tryin' to block it
""Daddy please, daddy, don't leave, daddy, no, stop it""
Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket
It's got a picture, ""This will keep you safe daddy, take it with ya""
I look up, it's just me standin' in the mirror
These fuckin' walls must be talkin', 'cause man I can hear 'em
They're sayin', ""you got one more chance to do right
And it's tonight, now go out and show em that you love 'em before it's too late""
And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door
It turns to a stage, they're gone and the spotlight is on and I'm singin'
And when I'm gone just carry on don't mourn,
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that,
I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing so baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back
And when I'm gone just carry on don't mourn,
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that,
I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing so baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back
Sixty thousand people all jumpin' out their seat
The curtain closes, they're throwin' roses at my feet
I take a bow, and thank you all for comin out
They're screamin' so loud, I take one last look at the crowd
I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seein'
""Daddy, its me, help mommy, her wrists are bleedin'""
But baby we're in Sweden
How did you get to Sweden?
""I followed you daddy
You told me that you weren't leavin'
You lied to me dad, and now you made mommy sad
And I bought you this coin, it says number one dad
That's all I wanted, I just want to give you this coin""
""I get the point, fine, me and mommy are goin'""
""But baby wait, it's too late dad, you made your choice
Now go out there and show em that you love em more than us
That's what they want
They want you, Marshall
They keep screamin' your name
It's no wonder you can't go to sleep
Just take another pill, yeah I bet you you will!
You rap about it, yeah word, kid keep it real""
I hear a applause, all this time I couldn't see
How could it be, that the curtain is closin' on me
I turn around, find a gun on the ground
Cock it, put it to my brain, scream Die Shady! And pop it
The sky darkens, my life flashes
The plane that I was supposed to be on, crashes, and burns to ashes
That's when I wake up
Alarm clock's ringing, there's birds singin'
It's spring and Hailie's outside swingin'
I walk right up to Kim and kiss her tell her I miss her
Hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister almost as if to say
And when I'm gone just carry on don't mourn,
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that,
I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing so baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back
And when I'm gone just carry on don't mourn,
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that,
I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing so baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back"

""So why's your face red? Man you wasted!""
Well since age twelve, I've felt like I'm someone else
'Cause I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt
Got pissed off and ripped Pamela Lee's tits off
And smacked her so hard I knocked her clothes backwards like Kris Kross
I smoke a fat pound of grass and fall on my ass, faster than a fat bitch

My English teacher wanted to flunk me in Junior High
Thanks a lot next semester I'll be thirty five
I smacked him in his face with an eraser,
Chased him with a stapler
Stapled his nuts to a stack of papers (Ow!)
Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up
Flashed the bartender, then stuck my dick in the tip cup
Extraterrestrial, running over pedestrians in a space ship
While they screamin' at me ""Let's just be friends!""
Ninety-nine percent of my life I was lied to
I just found out my mom does more dope than I do (Damn!)
I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper
Make a record about doin' drugs and name it after her (Oh thank you!)
You know you blew up when the women rush your stands
Try to touch your hands like some screamin' Usher fans (Ahh!)
This guy at White Castle asked for my autograph (Dude, can I get your autograph?)

I'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive
(Huh yup!) Am I comin' or goin'?
I can barely decide
I just drank a fifth of vodka,
Dare me to drive? (Go ahead) all my life I was very deprived
I ain't had a woman in years, and my palms are too hairy to hide
(Whoops!) Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk
I spit when I talk, I'll fuck anything that walks (C'mere)
When I was little I used to get so hungry I would throw fits
How you gonna breast feed me Mom? You ain't got not tits!
I lay awake and strap myself in the bed
Put a bulletproof vest on and shoot myself in the head (Bang!)

guilty-conscience,2005,eminem,Hip-Hop,"Meet Eddie, twenty-three years old.
Fed up with life and the way things are going,
He decides to rob a liquor store.
(""I can't take this no more, I can't take it no more homes"")
But on his way in, he has a sudden change of heart.
And suddenly, his conscience comes into play
(""Shit is mine, I gotta do this, gotta do this"")
Alright, stop! (Huh?)
Now before you walk in the door of this liquor store
And try to get money out the drawer
You better think of the consequence (But who are you?)
I'm your motherfuckin' conscience
That's nonsense!
Go in and gaffle the money and run to one of your aunt's cribs
And borrow a damn dress, and one of her blonde wigs
Tell her you need a place to stay
You'll be safe for days if you shave your legs with Renee's razor blade
Yeah but if it all goes through like it's supposed to
The whole neighborhood knows you and they'll expose you
Think about it before you walk in the door first
Look at the store clerk, she's older than George Burns
Fuck that! Do that shit! Shoot that bitch!
Can you afford to blow this shit? Are you that rich?
Why you give a fuck if she dies? Are you that bitch?
Do you really think she gives a fuck if you have kids?
Man, don't do it, it's not worth it to risk it! (You're right!)
Not over this shit (Stop!)
Drop the biscuit (I will!)
Don't even listen to Slim yo, he's bad for you
(You know what Dre? I don't like your attitude)

Meet Stan, twenty-one years old. (""Give me a kiss!"")
After meeting a young girl at a rave party,
Things start getting hot and heavy in an upstairs bedroom.
Once again, his conscience comes into play (""Shit!"")
Now listen to me, while you're kissin' her cheek
And smearin' her lipstick, I slipped this in her drink
Now all you gotta do is nibble on this little bitch's earlobe
(Yo! This girl's only fifteen years old
You shouldn't take advantage of her, that's not fair)
Yo, look at her bush, does it got hair? (Uh huh!)
Fuck this bitch right here on the spot bare
Til she passes out and she forgot how she got there
(Man, ain't you ever seen that one movie ""Kid"")
No, but I seen the porno with SunDoobiest!
(Shit, you wanna get hauled off to jail?)
Man fuck that, hit that shit raw dog and bail
Meet Grady, a twenty-nine year old construction worker.
After coming home from a hard day's work,
He walks in the door of his trailer park home
To find his wife in bed with another man.
(""What the fuck!"")
(""Grady!"")
Alright calm down, relax, start breathin'
Fuck that shit, you just caught this bitch cheatin'
While you at work she's with some dude tryin' to get off?
Fuck slittin' her throat, cut this bitches head off!
Wait! What if there's an explanation for this shit?
(What? She tripped? Fell? Landed on his dick?)
Alright Shady, maybe he's right Grady
But think about the baby before you get all crazy
Okay! Thought about it, still wanna stab her?
Grab her by the throat, get your daughter and kidnap her?
That's what I did, be smart, don't be a retard
You gonna take advice from somebody who slapped Dee Barnes?
What you say? (What's wrong?
Didn't think I'd remember?)
I'm a kill you motherfucker!
Uh-ah! Temper temper!
Mr. Dre? Mr. N.W.A.?
Mr. AK comin' straight outta Compton y'all better make way?
How in the fuck you gonna tell this man not to be violent?
'Cause he don't need to go the same route that I went
Been there, done that, aw fuck it
What am I sayin'?
Shoot em both Grady, where's your gun at?"
lose-yourself,2005,eminem,Hip-Hop,"Look
If you had
One shot
Or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted
In one moment
Would you capture it
Or just let it slip?
Yo
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgettin'
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's chokin', how, everybody's jokin' now
The clocks run out, times up, over, blaow!
Snap back to reality, oh there goes gravity
Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked
He's so mad, but he won't give up that easy? No
He won't have it, he knows his whole back city's ropes
It don't matter, he's dope, he knows that, but he's broke
He's so stacked that he knows, when he goes back to his mobile home, that's when its
Back to the lab again yo, this whole rhapsody
He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better
The souls escaping, through this hole that its gaping
This world is mine for the taking
Make me king, as we move toward a, new world order
A normal life is borin', but super stardom's close to post mortem
It only grows harder, only grows hotter
He blows us all over these hoes is all on him
Coast to coast shows, he's known as the globetrotter
Lonely roads, God only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water
His hoes don't want him no mo, he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmo who flows, he nose dove and sold nada
So the soap opera is told and unfolds, I suppose it's old partna, but the beat goes on
Da da dumb da dumb da da
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better
No more games, I'm a change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginnin', the mood all changed
I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin' and stepwritin' the next cipher
Best believe somebody's payin' the pied piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine to
Five and I can't provide the right type of
Life for my family 'cause man, these God damn food stamps don't buy diapers
And its no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer
This is my life and these times are so hard
And it's getting even harder tryin' to feed and water my seed, plus
See dishonor caught up between bein' a father and a prima-donna
Baby mama drama screamin' on and too much
For me to want to say in one spot, another jam or not
Has gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail I've got
To formulate a plot fore I end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failures not
Mom, I love you, but this trail has got to go, I cannot grow old in Salem's lot
So here I go is my shot
Feet fail me not 'cause maybe the only opportunity that I got
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment

way-i-am-the,2005,eminem,Hip-Hop,"Whatever
Dre just let it run
Ey yo turn the beat up a little bit
Ey yo this song is for anyone
Fuck it just shut up and listen
Ey yo
I sit back, with this pack, of zigzags
And this bag, of this weed
It gives me, the shit needed to be, the most meanest MC on this
On this earth 'cause since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse
And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
And it sells and it helps in its self to relieve
All this tension dispensing me, sentence is getting it
The stress has been eating me, recently
Off of this chest and I rest to get peacefully
But at least have the decency in you to leave me alone
When you freaks see me out in the streets
When I'm eating or feeding my daughter to not come and speak to me
I don't know you and no I don't owe you a motherfuckin' thing
I'm not Mr.'N Sync and I'm not what your friends think
I'm not Mr.Friendly, I can be a prick, if you tempt me my tank is on empty
No patience is in me and if you offend me I'm lifting you ten feet
In the air, I don't care who was there and who saw me just jaw you
Go call you a lawyer
File you a lawsuit, I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
I'm tired of all you
I don't mean to be mean but it's all I can be, it's just me
And I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the papers, the news, everyday I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the papers, the news, everyday I am
I don't know it's just the way I am
Sometimes I just feel like my father, I hate to be bothered
With all of this nonsense it's constant, and ""oh it's his lyrical content!""
The song ""Guilty Conscience"" has gotten such rotten responses
And all of this controversy circles me and it seems
Like the media immediately points a finger at me
So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or the pinky
Or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up when you don't give a fuck
When you won't just put up with the bullshit they pull
'Cause they full of shit too
When a dude's gettin' bullied and shoots up his school
And they blame it on Marilyn
And the heroin, where were the parents at?
And look at where it's at
Middle America, now it's a tragedy, now it's so sad to see
An upper class city having this happening

They cop me rotation at rock 'n' roll stations
And I just do not got the patience
To deal with these cocky Caucasians
Who think I'm some wigga who just tries to be black
'Cause I talk with an accent and grab on my balls
So they always keep asking the same fucking questions

Fuck it just shut up and listen

I sit back, with this pack, of zigzags
And this bag, of this weed
It gives me, the shit needed to be, the most meanest MC on this
On this earth 'cause since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse
And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
And it sells and it helps in its self to relieve
All this tension dispensing me, sentence is getting it
The stress has been eating me, recently
Off of this chest and I rest to get peacefully
But at least have the decency in you to leave me alone
When you freaks see me out in the streets
When I'm eating or feeding my daughter to not come and speak to me
I don't know you and no I don't owe you a motherfuckin' thing
I'm not Mr.'N Sync and I'm not what your friends think
I'm not Mr.Friendly, I can be a prick, if you tempt me my tank is on empty
No patience is in me and if you offend me I'm lifting you ten feet
In the air, I don't care who was there and who saw me just jaw you
Go call you a lawyer
File you a lawsuit, I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
I'm tired of all you
I don't mean to be mean but it's all I can be, it's just me

Sometimes I just feel like my father, I hate to be bothered
With all of this nonsense it's constant, and ""oh it's his lyrical content!""
The song ""Guilty Conscience"" has gotten such rotten responses
And all of this controversy circles me and it seems
Like the media immediately points a finger at me
So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or the pinky
Or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up when you don't give a fuck
When you won't just put up with the bullshit they pull
'Cause they full of shit too
When a dude's gettin' bullied and shoots up his school
And they blame it on Marilyn
And the heroin, where were the parents at?
And look at where it's at
Middle America, now it's a tragedy, now it's so sad to see
An upper class city having this happening

cleanin-out-my-closet,2005,eminem,Hip-Hop,"Where's my snare?
I have no snare in my headphones
there you go
Yeah
yo, yo
Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?
I have, I've been protested and demonstrated against
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times
Sick as the mind of the motherfucking kid that's behind
All this commotion emotions run deep as ocean's exploding
Tempers flaring from parents just blow 'em off and keep going
Not taking nothing from no one give 'em hell long as I'm breathing
Keep kicking ass in the morning and taking names in the evening
Leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth
See they can trigger me, but they'll never figure me out
Look at me now, I bet ya probably sick of me now ain't you momma?
I'mma make you look so ridiculous now
I'm sorry momma!
I never meant to hurt you!
I never meant to make you cry, but tonight
I'm cleaning out my closet (one more time)
I said I'm sorry momma!
I never meant to hurt you!
I never meant to make you cry, but tonight
I'm cleaning out my closet
Ha! I got some skeletons in my closet
And I don't know if no one knows it
So before they thrown me inside my coffin and close it
I'mma expose it, I'll take you back to '73
Before I ever had a multi-platinum selling CD
I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months
My faggot father must have had his panties up in a bunch
'Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
No I don't. On second thought I just fucking wished he would die
I look at Hailie, and I couldn't picture leaving her side
Even if I hated Kim, I grit my teeth and I'd try
To make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake
I maybe made some mistakes, but I'm only human
but I'm man enough to face them today
What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets outta that gun
'Cause I'da killed him, shit I would've shot Kim and him both
It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to ""The Eminem Show""
I'm sorry momma!
I never meant to hurt you!
I never meant to make you cry, but tonight
I'm cleaning out my closet (one more time)
I said I'm sorry momma!
I never meant to hurt you!
I never meant to make you cry, but tonight
I'm cleaning out my closet
Now I would never diss my own momma just to get recognition
Take a second to listen for who you think this record is dissing
But put yourself in my position, just try to envision
Witnessing your momma popping prescription pills in the kitchen
Bitching that someone's always going through her purse and shit's missing
Going through public housing systems, victim of Munchhausen's Syndrome
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't
'Til I grew up, now I blew up, it makes you sick to ya stomach
Doesn't it? Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me Ma?
So you could try to justify the way you treated me Ma?
But guess what? You're getting older now and it's cold when you're lonely
And Nathan's growing up so quick he's gonna know that you're phony
And Hailie's getting so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful
But you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral!
See what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong
Bitch do your song, keep telling yourself that you was a mom!
But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get
You selfish bitch, I hope you fucking burn in hell for this shit
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me?
Well guess what, I am dead, dead to you as can be!
I'm sorry momma!
I never meant to hurt you!
I never meant to make you cry, but tonight
I'm cleaning out my closet (one more time)
I said I'm sorry momma!
I never meant to hurt you!
I never meant to make you cry, but tonight
I'm cleaning out my closet"
sing-for-the-moment,2005,eminem,Hip-Hop,"These ideas are nightmares to white parents
Whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings
Like whatever they say has no bearing
It's so scary in a house that allows no swearing
To see him walking around with his headphones blaring
Alone in his own zone, cold and he don't care
He's a problem child, what bothers him all comes out
When he talks about his fuckin' dad walkin' out
Cause he hates him so bad that he blocks him out
If he ever saw him again, he'd probably knock him out
His thoughts are whacked, he's mad so he's talkin' back
Talkin' black, brainwashed from rock and rap
He sags his pants, do rags and a stocking cap
His stepfather hit him so he socked him back
And broke his nose, this house is a broken home
There's no control, he just let's his emotions go
(Come on) Sing with me, (Sing), sing for the years
(Sing it) Sing for the laughter, sing for the tears (Come on)
Sing it with me, just for today,
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away
Entertainment is changing, intertwining' with gangsters
In the land of the killers, a sinner's mind is a sanctum
Holy or unholy, only have one homie
Only this gun, lonely, 'cause don't anyone know me
But everybody just feels like they can relate
I guess words are a motherfucker, they can be great
Or they can degrade, or even worse, they can teach hate
It's like these kids hang on every single statement we make
Like they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum
Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen?
From standin' on corners and porches just rappin'
To havin' a fortune, no more kissin' ass
But then these critics crucify you, journalists try to burn you
Fans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you
To get their hands on every dime you have
They want you to lose your mind every time you mad
So they can try to make you out to look like a loose canon
Any dispute, won't hesitate to produce handguns
That's why these prosecutors wanna convict me
Strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly
But all their kids been listenin' to me religiously
So I'm signing CD's while police fingerprint me
They're for the judges daughter, but his grudge is against me
If I'm such a fuckin' menace, this shit doesn't make sense b
It's all political, if my music is literal then I'm a criminal
How the fuck can I raise a little girl?
I couldn't, I wouldn't be fit to
You're full of shit too, Guerrera, that was a fist that hit you
(Come on) Sing with me, (Sing), sing for the years
(Sing it) Sing for the laughter, sing for the tears (Come on)
Sing it with me, just for today,
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away
They say music can alter moods and talk to you
Well can it load a gun up for you and cock it too?
Well if it can, then the next time you assault a dude
Just tell the judge it was my fault, and I'll get sued
See what these kids do, is hear about us totin' pistols
And they want to get one, 'cus they think the shit's cool
Not knowin' we're really just protectin' ourselves
We entertainers, of course the shit's affecting ourselves
You ignoramus but music is reflection of self
We just explain it, and then we get our checks in the mail
It's fucked up ain't it, how we can come from practically nothin'
To bein' able to have any fuckin' thing that we wanted
That's why we sing for these kids that don't have a thing
Except for a dream and a fuckin' rap magazine
Who post pinup pictures on their walls all day long
Idolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs
Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in they lives
'Til they sit and they cry at night, wishing they die
'Til they throw on a rap record, and they sit and they vibe
We're nothing to you, but we're the fuckin' shit in their eyes
That's why we seize the moment, and try to freeze it and own it
Squeeze it and hold it, 'cause we consider these minutes golden
And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone
Just let our spirits live on, through our lyrics that you hear in our songs
And we can
(Come on) Sing with me, (Sing), sing for the years
(Sing it) Sing for the laughter, sing for the tears (Come on)
Sing it with me, just for today,
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away
(Come on) Sing with me, (Sing), sing for the years
(Sing it) Sing for the laughter, sing for the tears (Come on)
Sing it with me, just for today,
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away"

Some vodka that will jump start my heart quicker

When I'm rocking the table while he's operating ""Hey""
You waited this long to stop debating
'Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating

Embarrassed, their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feeling like prisoners helpless
'Til someone comes along on a mission and yells ""bitch""
A visionary, vision is scary,
Could start a revolution, pollutin' the air waves a rebel
So let me just revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissing my ass
And it's a disaster such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my ass you ask for me
Well I'm back, nana-na na na nana-na na na kshh
Fix your bent antenna, tune it in and then I'm gonna enter in endin' up
Under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention back for the winter
I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kids ears and nesting
""Testing attention please""

Here's my ten cents, my two cents is free
A nuisance, who sent, you sent for me?

I go tit for tat with anybody who's talking this shit and that shit
Chris Kirkpatrick, you can get your ass kicked
Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards
And Moby, you can get stomped by Obie
You thirty six year old bald headed fag, blow me
You don't know me, you're too old, let it go its over,
Nobody listens to Techno
Now lets go, just give me the signal
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
But sometimes this shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me I'm just obscene
Though I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do black music so selfishly
And use it to get myself wealthy
""Hey"" there's a concept that works
Twenty million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It will be so empty without me
Now this looks like a job for me

marshall-mathers-lp,2002,eminem,Hip-Hop,"You know I just don't get it
Last year I was nobody, this year I'm sellin' records
Now everybody wants to come around like I owe 'em somethin'
Heh, the fuck you want from me, ten million dollars?
Get the fuck out of here
You see I'm, just Marshall Mathers
I'm just a regular guy, I don't know why all the fuss about me
Nobody ever gave a fuck before all they did was doubt me
Now everybody wanna run their mouth and try to take shots at me
Yo, you might see me joggin', you might see me walkin'
You might see me walkin' a dead rottweiler dog
With it's head chopped off in the park with a spiked collar
Hollerin' at him 'cause the son of a bitch won't quit barkin'
Or leanin' out a window, with a cocked shotgun
Drivin' up the block in the car that they shot 'Pac in
Lookin' for Big's killers, dressed in ridiculous
Blue and red like I don't see what the big deal is
Double barrel twelve gauge, thinkin' of Chris Wallace
Pissed off 'cause Biggie and 'Pac just missed all this
Watchin' all these cheap imitations get rich off 'em
And get dollars that shoulda been there's like they switched wallets
And amidst all this Crist' poppin' and wrist watches
I had to sit back and just watch and just get nauseous
And walk around with an empty bottle of Remi Martin
Startin' shit like some 26 year old skinny Cartman
I'm anti-Backstreet and Ricky Martin
With instincts to kill N'Sync, don't get me started
These fuckin' brats can't sing and Britney's garbage
What's this bitch retarded? Gimme back my sixteen dollars
All I see is sissies in magazines smiling
Whatever happened to whylin' out and bein' violent?
Whatever happened to catchin' a good ol' fashioned
Passionate ass-whoopin' and gettin' your shoes coat
And your hat tooken?
New Kids on the Block, sucked a lot of dick
Boy/girl groups make me sick
And I can't wait 'til I catch all you faggots in public
I'ma love it
Vanilla Ice don't like me
Said some shit in Vibe to spite me
Then went and dyed his hair just like me
A bunch of little kids wanna swear just like me
And run around screamin, ""I don't care, just bite me""
I think I was put here to annoy the world
And destroy your little 4 year old boy or girl
Plus I was put here to put fear in faggots who spray Faygo Root Beer
And call themselves, clowns, 'cause they look queer
Faggot2Dope and Silent Gay
Claimin' Detroit, when y'all live twenty miles away
And I don't wrestle, I'll knock you fuckin' faggots the fuck out
Ask 'em about the club they was at when they snuck out
After they ducked out the back when they saw us and bugged out
Ducked down and got paintballs shot at they truck, blaow
Look at y'all runnin' your mouth again
When you ain't seen a fuckin' Mile Road, South of 10
And I don't need help from D-12 to beat up two females
In make-up, who may try to scratch me with Lee Nails
""Slim Anus,"" you damn right, Slim Anus
I don't get fucked in mine like you two little flaming faggots
'Cause I'm just Marshall Mathers
I'm not a wrestler guy, I'll knock you out if you talk about me
Come and see me on the streets alone if you assholes doubt me
And if you wanna run your mouth then come take your best shot at me
Is it because you love me that y'all expect so much of me?
You little groupie bitch, get off me, go fuck Puffy
Now because of this blonde mop that's on top
And this fucked up head that I've got, I've gone pop?
The underground just spunned around and did a 360
Now these kids diss me and act like some big sissies
""Oh, he just did some shit with Missy
So now he thinks he's too big to do some shit with MC Get-Bizzy""
My fuckin' bitch mom's suin' for ten million
She must want a dollar for every pill I've been stealin'
Shit, where the fuck you think I picked up the habit?
All I had to do was go in her room and lift up her mattress
Which is it bitch, Mrs. Briggs or Ms. Mathers?
It doesn't matter you faggot
Talkin' about I fabricated my past
He's just aggravated I won't ejaculate in his ass
So tell me, what the hell is a fella to do?
For every million I make, another relative sues
Family fightin' and fussin' over who wants to invite me to supper
All the sudden, I got 90-some cousins
(Hey, it's me)
A half-brother and sister who never seen me
Or even bothered to call me until they saw me on TV
Now everybody's so happy and proud
I'm finally allowed to step foot in my girlfriend's house
Hey, hey and then to top it off, I walked to the newsstand
To buy this cheap-ass little magazine with a food stamp
Skipped to the last page, flipped right fast
And what do I see? A picture of my big white ass
Okay, let me give you motherfuckers some help
Uhh, here double XL, double XL
Now your magazine shouldn't have so much trouble to sell
Ahh fuck it, I'll even buy a couple myself
'Cause I'm, just Marshall Mathers
I'm just a regular guy, I don't know why all the fuss about me
Nobody ever gave a fuck before, all they did was doubt me
Now everybody wanna run they mouth and take shots at me
'Cause I'm, just Marshall Mathers
I'm just a regular guy, I don't know why all the fuss about me
Nobody ever gave a fuck before, all they did was doubt me
Now everybody wanna run they mouth and take shots at me"
schooling,2002,eminem,Hip-Hop,"OK, I'm going to attempt to drown myself
You can try this at home
You can be just like me!
Mic check one two.. we recordin?
I'm cancerous, so when I diss you wouldn't wanna answer this
If you responded back with a battle rap you wrote for Canibus
I strangled you to death then I choked you again
Then break your fuckin legs till your bones poke through your skin
You beef wit me, I'ma even the score equally
Take you on Jerry Springer, and beat yer ass legally
I get you blunted off of funny home grown
Cause when I smoke out I hit the trees harder than Sonny Bono
(Ohh no!!) So if I said I never did drugs
That would mean I lie AND get fucked more than the President does
Hillary Clinton tried to slap me and call me a pervert
I ripped her fuckin tonsils out and fed her sherbet (Bitch!)
My nerves hurt, and lately I'm on edge
Grabbed Vanilla Ice and ripped out his blonde dreads (Fuck you!)
Every girl I ever went out wit is goin lez
Follow me and do exactly what the song says:
smoke weed, take pills, drop outta school, kill people and drink
And jump behind the wheel like it was still legal
I'm dumb enough to walk in a store and steal
So I'm dumb enough to ask for a date with Lauryn Hill
Some people only see that I'm white, ignorin skill
Cause I stand out like a green hat with a orange bill
But I don't get pissed, y'all don't even see through the mist
How the fuck can I be white, I don't even exist
I get a clean shave, bathe, go to a rave
Die from an overdose and dig myself up out of my grave
My middle finger won't go down, how do I wave?
And this is how I'm supposed to teach kids how to behave?
Now follow me and do exactly what you see
Don't you wanna grow up to be just like me!
I slap women and eat shrooms then O.D.
Now don't you wanna grow up to be just like me!
Me and Marcus Allen went over to see Nicole
When we heard a knock at the door, must have been Ron Gold'
Jumped behind the door, put the orgy on hold
Killed em both and smeared blood in a white Bronco (we did it!)
My mind won't work if my spine don't jerk
I slapped Garth Brooks out of his Rhinestone shirt
I'm not a player just a ill rhyme sayer
That'll spray an Aerosol can up at the ozone layer (psssssssh)
My rap style's warped, I'm runnin out the morgue
witcha dead grandmother's corpse to throw it on your porch
Jumped in a Chickenhawk cartoon wit a cape on
And beat up Foghorn Leghorn with an acorn
I'm bout as normal as Norman Bates, with deformative traits
A premature birth that was four minutes late
Mother.. are you there? I love you
I never meant to hit you over the head with that shovel
Will someone explain to my brain that I just severed
a main vein with a chainsaw and I'm in pain?
I take a breather and sighed; either I'm high, or I'm nuts
Cause if you ain't tiltin this room, neither am I
So when you see your mom with a thermometer shoved in her ass
Then it probably is obvious I got it on with her
Cause when I drop this solo shit it's over with
I bought Cage's tape, opened it, and dubbed over it"

She was sweetest young thing in this life
Had two kids and worked nights, never had shit, but we ate right
And slept tight, my daddy's livin the bad life
Used to come home nights and beat on his wife
I was too young to really understand about life
Used to cry a lot, hopin that my father get shot
Plus he sniff a lot (What that nigga beef about every fuckin day?)
My brother said something got to make him stop
'cause mommy go to hard for every little thing we got
It was a stress and pain, had a young child, goin insane
Until one day, he slapped my brother right in the face
And my mother started running all over the place
I went downstairs and grab the nine from the safe
Went back upstairs and put the shit right in his face
What up now daddy, I shot him in the face and smiled loud
Now her body froze, lookin at my father die slow
She can't believe it though, started screamin baby don't go
He said two words, and breath went dead and blood fled
My face turned red, couldn't understand what I did
Brother scared as shit, losin my mind, my moms flip
Tears from my eye drip, I grabbed her tightly and kissed
I said we miss him, but no longer do we go thru this shit
So when the cops come, I'm the one that let off the gun
Only thing I'm askin, when I get a visit, you come
Tell my brother 'bout the story, right now, he too young
'cause he can't figure out the things that we've been through
The lifestyles that's goin on now, life is so wild"
get-ready,2002,eminem,Hip-Hop,"Yo. yo! (* Eminem hachs up spit *)
Mic check. (My dick!)
Testing. one, two (* Eminem hach-spits on mic *)
Ffff-fuck. (My dick!) My nuts.
My attitude is worse than NWA's was
I'll battle you over stupid shit and diss people
who ain't have shit to do with it, like Cool J does (My tattoo!)
You see me standin outside of your buildin; screamin,
""Puffy is good, (HEY!) but Slim Shady is for the children!"" (WAIT!)
I look at my life in a new light -- fuck it
Give me two mics; I write songs for me -- fuck what you like
You're probably hear me rap half-hearted; cause I don't like rap anyway
I'm just tryin to get my porno career started
Every place and event. +Been There, Done That+
Shit, Dre stuck me in a suitcase when he went
(* zipper sound *) ""Come on, let's go!""
Want a deal? Study these 5 chapters
Lesson One: Throw demos as hard as you can at signed rappers
Lesson Two: Face em and diss em (whattup dog?)
Don't give em a demo; kidnap em (I want you to come with me)
and make em come to your basement and listen
(you're gonna fuckin check this out)
Lesson Three: Get a job at a label; switch demos with Canibus
and put yours on the owner's table (here listen!)
Lesson Four: 'Know you heard this before'
""Hey let me get your number; I'll call you tomorrow, for sure!""
Don't act like a fan -- you wanna get signed?
Get the whitest A&R; you can find
Pull him aside and rap as wack as you can
Lesson Five: Get a hook-up at Jive
Dress up like I.C.P. and have them come see you perform live
And that's the key, but when you see me on the street; I ain't
givin you shit bitch - don't even bother askin me (get away from me)
Toilet water splashes me right in the ass when I'm spittin
cause I'm always shittin when I'm rappin like Master P (UNNNGGGGH!)
Got a blowjob from Paula Jones, and stuffed it so far in her mouth
my balls broke both of her collarbones (OWW!)
Told Mya this shit was all about me-ah (""It's all about me."")
Gave Alyssa Milano syphillis, mono and gonorrhea (""You're a dick!"")
And all three of my main girls said SEE-YA
Cause Brandy and Monica walked in and caught me fuckin Aaliyah
(What? Oh my God!) I splish splash while I'm takin a bath
Grab a handful of pills, break em in half, take em and laugh
White trash -- fuckin your wife in the ass (""Oh! Ooh Shady! Oooh!"")
While you're out siphoning gas for your lawnmower to cut the grass
So if I hurt your self-esteem
and you get dissed too bad [Yo why you diss me?]
You know I just be sayin that to Get You Mad
And when I rap about a buncha shit you wished you had [A big dick!]
You know I just be sayin that to Get You Mad

You know I just be sayin that to Get You Mad

What a wonderful day; I should go outside and play
Ain't no need to sit inside the house and hibernate
Hi Renee! (Oh hi!) I was just about to toss a live grenade
in your driveway (WHAT?) and drive away (* car peels out *)
Are you afraid of a blade made of a razor with AIDS
Blood drippin from it, rippin your stomach like a paper mache
You talk a lotta shit, but you was never ill though
I'm sick enough to beat you to death with a feather pillow
Tipped over some cows, just for a joke and a laugh (MOOOOO!)
Jumped up, choked a giraffe, snapped his neck and broke it in half
Wagin wars, went on stage and sprayed Cage with +Agent Orange+
And wiped my ass with his page in Source (Here!)
The demon is here, steamin this year
I rip [*Mystikal's*] voicebox out, scream in his ear (AHHHHHH!)
It's not a gimmick bitch, it's an image I live it
Give a fuck? I don't know what a fuck is to give it
""Yeah I don't think this guy is well."" I'm high as hell
I'll beat you with a live cat when I'm swinging him by his tail
[* impersonating Method Man *]
I'll fuckin, I'll fuckin
Lay your nuts on the dresser
Just your nutsack by itself
And bang them shits with a spiked bat
Cut your neck off and sew your head right back
And leave you like that
You just triggered the prick who just mixed liquor
Who's itchin to leave you disfigured and stiffer than Chris-topher
Reeves, I was teething with strep throat
while your mother was breastfeeding
And gave her the flesh-eating disease
I'm iller than takin a hammer and beatin your knees
and walkin through South Central L.A., bleedin in jeans
(Am I a Blood or a Crip?) Wakin up the next day in breathin machines
Flashin back to being shot and repeatin the scenes
on how you just got smoked, and if you do live
You'll be too scared to tell it, like a Biggie and 'Pac joke
So if I hurt your self-esteem and you get dissed too bad
You know I just be sayin that to Get You Mad
And when I rap about a fat bitch that you wished you had
You know I just be sayin that to Get You Mad
""I can't listen to that song, that shit's too sad""
You know I just be sayin that to Get You Mad
""He'll never make it, his wrist is slit too bad""

Bring the beat back
Bring me two extension chords
Imma measure my dick shit I need 6 inches more
Fuck my dicks big bitch
Need I remind you that I dont need the fucking swine flu to be a sick pig
Youre addicted Im dope
Im the longest needle around here
Need a fix up Im the big shot
Get it dicks nuts
Your just small boats little pricks
Girl you think that other pricks hot
Ill drink gasoline and eat a lit match
Fore I sit back and let em get hot
Better call the cops on em quick fast
Shadys right back on your bitch ass
White trash with a half of six pack in his hatchback
Trailer hitched attached to the back (dispatch)
You can sound the alarm
You can call out your guards
You can fence in your yard
You can pull all the cards
But I wont back down
Oh no I wont back down
Oh no
Bitch am I the reason that your boyfriend stopped rapping
Does a bird chirp, Lil Wayne slurps syrup til he burps
And smokes purp does a wordsearch gets circles wrapped around him like
You do when I come through, Id like you to remind yourself
Of what the fuck I can do when Im on the mic
Or your the kind of girl that I can take a liking to
Psych Im spiking you like a football
Been this way since Ive stood a foot tall
Youre a good catch with a shitty spouse
Got a pretty mouth and a good jaw
Gimme good brain
Watch the wood grain, dont want no cum stain
Bitch you listening tryna turn me down
Slut m talking to you, turn me back up
Are you insane tryna talk over me in the car
Shut the fuck up while my shits playin
Ima shit stain on the underwear of life
Whats they saying? wheres thunder theres light
And they say that it never strikes twice in the same place
Then how the fuck have I been hit six times
In three different locations
On four separate occasions?
And you can bet your stanking ass
That Ive come to smash everything in my path
Fork was in the road took the psychopath
Poison ivy wouldnt have me thinking rash
So hit the dance floor cutie while I do my duty on this microphone
Shake your booty shawty Im the shit
Why you think Proof used to call me Doody
You can sound the alarm
You can call out your guards
You can fence in your yard
You can pull all the cards
But I wont back down
Oh no I wont back down
Oh no"

Slugs twist a bitch, nigga watch you sleep in a ditch
Pow-pow boogie to the big bang-bang
Lil' mama want to swang with the 213 gang (Number one boss playa)

Go out and twist something, come on

Twist ya body, baby, kiss me, by the way, you drive me crazy
Ain't nothing else that I can say

Trying to focus on what you working with in the front
Certain to set it off, she twurking it for the boss
So positive I can hit, my niggaz is in the house
Can't stop 'til I'm paid bitch, I just can't quit
But look at this, I'm on the same shit, ain't it bitch?
You niggaz talk a lot of shit

You won't witness ass niggaz get it twisted
This the wrong shit to get hit with

213
Childhood homies way back in the day
since then it's been 213 the hard way
Rapping on the street corners, young as can be
All the local groups called us Run-DMC
Me? Warren G, I was Jam Master Jay
Mixed with my big brother Dr. Dre
Now I got shouts to say
We still want Eazy like bedstyle people, we want Biggie
In memory of Tupac, Left Eye, Aaliyah
Heaven sent, say hi to my mama when you see her
Rest in peace but let's take it back to the streets
With so much drama in the LBC
It's kind of hard being a G from 213
Times was hard for a superstar
But don't nobody notice who you are
We worked hard and stayed true to the game
Kept faith, kept God and now you know our name
[Chorus - Nate Dogg]
A big shout out to all my family and friends
When times got hard, you were still be there
You give me inspiration like strength from the sun
Feel like destiny's son, yeah
[Snoop Dogg]
To be a rapper was my dream
And have a lot of money and live like a king
To have a handful of rings
And to make the kind of music that the whole world sings
Battle rap was the thing
And King Park was the spot where all the homeboys hang, bang
Just to go do our thang and form my gang
And took off white a white boy in a van to get our change
And moms knew what time it was
And loved the way her baby boy came up, 'cause
It's before I was Snoop Dogg on TV
I'm talking about when I was like a little bitty BG
Nigga me and Warren Gizzy and Nate Dizzy and Fatey Baby
are talking about eighty-threezy, flip the clock up to '93
And watch me rock the clock nonstop constantly
on MTV and BET whatever you want
Hit these niggaz with that motherfucking cheese (G-Funk)
Funk to shake ya trunk nigga from the bottom bunk
Now I'm moving on up, straight living it up
Well known in the zone and I'm still homegrown
Like Al be	Sure, shit I'm on my own
But there's one thing I'm missing and that's family
'cause without y'all I don't know where I'd be
[Chorus]
[Nate Dogg]
There's no way I can forget about you
Support for me, your love for me
Your prayers for me when I'm in these streets
And there's no way I can forget to thank ya
For showing me the true meaning of unconditional love ooohhh
When I be fucking up you always come with love
You say you've had enough
I just want to thank ya
Yeah yeah yeah
I just want to give

Funny how one thing leads to another
Funny how mothers cry
Funny how we live at night and in the gutter
Funny how cash rules everything around me
Funny how people never seem to change
Funny how my closest friends is my rebuttal
Seems like it all can change and I can get paid
Whoa!

Find a way to make some money

I was giving this a lot of thought
Should I trip? Should I not? Should I set this off?
A whole lotta pressure is on my shoulders
My soul is with all my niggaz I roll with; so know this
Cut the bullshit, take it back to the music
use it right, don't matter what you do with it
I'm here to represent the real
I still stayed G'ed up unless must I will
I stayed up all night, I argue and fight by myself; this can't be right
Hmm 'cause if the lights were the sound of the siren
I'd make you niggaz get a deal and act wild
I'm for real and I can see through these suckers that dick riding motherfuckers
Yeah, that's me bustin' 'cause I'm a huslter for the chips
And I'm trippin 'cause I'm sick of this shit
Listen
[Snoop Dogg]
It wasn't about money up front
All a nigga wanted was a big gold chain and a blunt
Why? What do you mean?
Living my Auntie Mary and I ain't having a damn thang
I can't get a job; I might as well steal and rob
Man, life is so hard
Hanging in my homie garage while other niggaz
doing killing for a living in the city of stars
I got a lick but I ain't got caught
Nigga slippin' leaving a sack by the bar
And I seen where he set it, thought he had hid it
Nope, and I'm about to go get it
Come up, I gotta stay run up
Left eye open while I'm sleep with the gun up
Please don't run up about that money I'm funny
My nigga you'll get done up

I want to do some nasty thangs, want to make her scream my name
I like the girls that don't say, ""what?,"" know that she fine
Always knows her line, because she knows she's a dime
Put her on platinum chains, got her own cash and things
I like them girls, their sassy ways, sassy ways
Oh I like them girls, man I could stay there for days
Ooooooooooooooooh

Why you so cute, why you so big
Why you bullshitin', come and deal with a pimp
Put your bags in the trunk, holla at your boy
You can spend the night, we at the Elroy
Doing things that we shouldn't, couldn't
Girl you got that good chocolate pudding
The best in hood, what's goodin'
She got the wizard of west wood, like old John Wooding
But how could I need that
I'm looking for feedback, because I can't believe that
I fell into a little tree sap
I got a woman at home, ain't fell in love where the weeds at
Started off with a dime, but by the time I was thug
She was less than a duece, I'm telling the truth
Confessing with you, I'm just messing with you
Because on the real baby girl, you put in the S in Snoop

See I rock baby, nonstop baby
Warren G baby, shake that thang lady

So you could kick it with baby, but get your mind right

Like that lil country whore I fucked a day ago
We were in Spokane but made it to Diego
Droppin' shit purposely lettin' her thong show
She didn't even know about a nigga mandingo
When she saw the joystick and wouldn't let go
She ain't playin' games, she want it right now
From the living room floor to the ouside patio
Bent over gently, I was proud to embrace it
Firmly grab it, rapidly get it crackin'
Most women I know, love the joystick
And love playing with it when it goes the extra inch
I'm a pro, anything goes at the spot
If you know about it, then be about it
If not..
She said she wants to ride my joystick
She wants to ride, she wants to ride
She act like she wanna ride my joystick
She wants to ride, she wants to ride
She wanted me, every part
But all I really want is dinner
Her company, at least at first
But now I wanna go up in her
While I'm hittin corners in my Chevrolet
I ran into a honey from around the way
Big Nate Dogg what can I say?
She asked for my number and some Alize
I got game, so I spit some game

When Mom's on rock I stay on top
Lock up like pits in a box I can't stop
Not cuz your beauty it's your booty that I'm attracted
Want to get acquainted, most acquainted with your assets
Roll with the best, yes my joystick
Tasty in all kinds of ways, you'll see
I'm a pro, anything goes at the spot
If know about it, then be about it
Cuz if not..
I bet she comin' home with me
She wants to come home and play with me
No fallin' in love with me
Can't spend the whole week with me
No sittin' up front with me
For the whole damn world to see

She act like she wanna ride my joystick
She wants to ride, she wants to ride
Yeah baby you said you don't know nothing about video games
But you know a whole lotta about joysticks, huh?
It's like Xbox and EA Sports
It's in the game, you dig?
So if you shift it from first gear to third gear
Just make sure you grab a hold of those two things up under
You know what I'm talking about?
Yeah, bizzalls, real talk
It's one of them joysticks that you could just
You know, slip n' slide to
Yeah you could ride to this
Real talk

For the 2000 plus 4
You what up, this is Big Snoop DOgg
If this call is about bullshit, borrowing money from me
Or negativity, hang up right now and call 9-1-1
Cuz I can't do nothing for you right now
But if it's a real call and a real conversation
Leave your name and number at the bizeep
And I'll get back like that"
lil-girl,2004,213,Hip-Hop,"Lil' girl from the ghetto ran away from home
Tryin' to be a fucking woman acting way too grown
Then she ran across the border homie, 24-inch chromes
Now she walking down the track and stripping
With them brand new high heels on
She too young for me so I passed her to the next dude
Got hood fame, what a shame what X' do
Hang with a crew that love getting revenue
With a description of 1972
Now who's the mack in the 'Lac leaning to the side
24's gleaming, sitting up high?
Ride and won't die but you young bitch
Spit words so fly, get you sprung, bitch
Young Slick, his name, chasing Don Juan fame
Trying to replace him with modern day game
We don't hate then shoot if you mess with his prostitute
And what I hear, he got a lot to shoot
Now what if dude get your crew Slick got one too?
Don't let the pimpin' fool you, he got hot ones too
Blew his brains out now he catching chain out to Chino's
Slick got caught up fucking with a young dogg
My nigga Slick was a gangbang motherfucking lunatic
Nigga out to get a grip, sworn in to do this shit
Nigga only do this shit and make this shit official
A little bitty nigga quick to hit you with the pistol
Ain't no motherfuckers squabbin' me and that's on 20s
Plenty niggaz felt the wrath of his deuce-deuce gun blast
Ask 'cause on the corner with the bullet holes his chest blast
Dumb-dumb don't want come test
'Cause he'll lay you to rest, tattooed with a set on his neck
Demanding respect, Crip or die, is how he ride
Long Beach, East Side roll in two times
Every nigga on the yard know 'cause' rep
A straight gangsta for life and I love that
It's not just a job fool it's a lifestyle
And when you're slipping, woo-wam-lights-out
Lil' boy from the ghetto with you're greased up khaki's on
Used to be a ball player, homie what the fuck went wrong?
Used to see him on the corner daily hand up on his throne
Tried to knock him off a bank recently, 25 to life, so long, he gone"

Hit hard, sock jaw, fall on your back
No bodyguards imagine and all that
Hear from the streets like 'where my doggs at?'
Keep 'em with heat in case they involve gats
9-11 is for certain hurry call back
Don't paid to get dirt done, now what you call that?
So much love on the streets I can take a fall back
My credentials is based on all facts some things you can hate on

Doing it for the whole wizord

If it happened to me, it can happen to you
Watch out, they shootin'
Look good for a nigga now

I started at the bottom so ain't nothing to do
But come up with the homies that I call my crew
Stay true to the game, kept it the same
Despite the fame
Maintain through the downs we kept our heads up, remain

Tried to hit a n**** up until he seen how we strut
I'm like 'N****, take two steps back
Now lower your voice before you get pimp slapped'

Way back in the days when I was with Fab' Five Freddy
I told you then, I told you now, boy I stay ready
Don't sweat it, we'll get him and then let him
Talk s*** for a minute then deal with him

A pool party at the church
G'd up and others barbequeing
Ain't no telling what your daddy and your momma doing
Chewing on these baby-backs popping bottles with these macks
Everybody swimming, backyard full of women
I'm entertaining folks
Gave the lil' homie twenty dollars just to shine my hundred spokes
Coke with the Hennesey tends to be the remedy
Family and friends to me
Everyone pretends to be kin to me
I can't wait until the Fourth of July
to pop some fireworks with my kids
and fly some kites high in the sky
See, it's the family reunion
And down at the church house, they giving up the annual communion
It seems we made it to another summer
Yeah we came and come up
213 is more than friends
Yeah, we like blood brothers
Riding this 'til the wheels fall off
Can you dig that?
We got this summertime anthem for y'all
We did that
[Chorus - Latoiya Williams]
We made it through winter
We made it through fall
We made it through the spring time
Tough times and all
It's good to see
I love the summer
I'm riding with the top down
Let the wind blow
Chillin' with my love
Partying fo' sho'
It feels good to see
I love the summer
Everybody if you with me sing
[Nate Dogg]
We got the game on lock
On the paper chase, can't stop
On a roll, still hot
Gotta be top notch
I like the girls 'cause they hot
Plus I know what they want
They want the game that we got
Hold up baby girl I think not
I like the nasty girls from around the way
Hoppin' in my gray drop-top Mercedes
Shouts go out to my sexy ladies
Just in case your man is hating
Tell your boy he better chill (Summertime)
Tell your boy he better chill (Summertime)
[Chorus]
[Warren G]
I'm addicted to the sunshine the way it make these women dress
Tank tops, flip flops, make this nigga love the west
Different spots, even though different, it's still crackin'
In Jamaica, Queens I sit back, live and collect the cabbage
It's an affair that every state can relate to
And if you do what I do, then go on and follow suit
From Chi-Town to Diego, all the way back to NY
Stay fly, and never miss a piece of sunshine
When I'm at the church I barbeque for my kinfolk
Watch lil' Elijah and lil' Warren run the football
Got weed, got drink, but most of all the spirit
And it's a blessin' that the world want to hear our music
The summer is an inspiration as much as the fast
And to my my nigga Snoopdewoop, I love you fam'

Riding this 'til the wheels fall off

feels-good,2005,ambassador,Hip-Hop,"(feat. Da T.R.U.T.H & S.O.U.L)
[Chorus]
It feels good
'cause I know that I'm gonna cry
But I know where I go when I die
It feels good
I don't have to know how to fly
Just walk in the road with my God
It feels good
when you don't have to run from the cops
And don't wake up to the block
It feels good
Not to be duped by a lie
But know how to use the truth to survive
It feels good
[Verse 1]
Used to be a time when I was bound in chains
Flesh rumblin'
kind of like the sound of trains
Faith dead
kind of like what's found in James
Heaven's hound turned me around and now I'm changed
And it sounds strange until you see the way they start to
Live clean and free they're like AJ's partner
Even in regular stuff whether it's cheddar or not
He gets glory from the sacred and secular yep!
The lesson is what, this
There's a life to get
More than clubs, more than ice and Chris
That life's a trick
Treated with a hyped to get
You to forget without Christ true life was missed
[Chorus]
[Verse 2]
It feels good to be saved from the mindset
That I ain't have a story just because I wasn't raised in the projects
Still makin' the progress; embracin' the process
If you're an ex-thug please take it in context
'Cause I ain't comin' at your neck but I recall when I thought
That I couldn't reach a thug laden with crime
Plus I've been delivered from feeling so out of place
'Cause I ain't fit like figure eights in a prom dress
The state of my mind's just been transformed by the truth
And God's Spirit when I faced the divine text
And now I'm free from the idea that to reach a thug I had to be a thug
The grace is of God yes!
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
It feels good to be able to control tongue
And if you get chumped not to have to load a gun
It feels
good to have green to get gasoline
Though the car has no dubs and no plasma screens
It feels good
just go to New York with wifey, Duce, and Meesh
To see Beauty and the Beast
It feels good
yea, to hit the studio and breeze
Back to the ranch and fulfill our duty as the priest
It feels good
In New York to go to Junior's for a cheesecake
Then come back to Philly 'cause you really wanna cheese-steak
It feels good
to take a Bible in a Starbucks
And read all about the God who hung the moon and the stars up
It feels good
just to sit and eat Dungeness crabs
And have talk about our wondrous Dad
It feels good just to know that your temple is clean
You don't need much more just the simpler things
[Chorus]
{harmonize}
It Feels Good"
intro,2005,ambassador,Hip-Hop,"Looks like it finally came around like the hands of a clock
Praise to Yahweh Nissi
Shout to the BannerShabach
This LP is two sidedfor the man on the block
And for the flock who thinks keeping God's commandment is hot
On one side we wanna represent Christ to the Culture
Hip-Hop mostly knows Him for making tight little posters
Or a sculpture, but they can't view Him like they're supposed to
'Cause the gospel's never been preached to them like its' supposed to
And the life in Christ has never even looked like an answer
Except for locked up crooks and Big Mas with cancer
So, Ambassador is back to give you his thesis
The greatest need in Hip-Hop is the input of Jesus
It's the thesis we need this
The story in short
Hip-Hop properly submitted to the glorious Lord
It's problematic 'cause
It can be scary to like
But... Jesus makes everything right
But... Jesus makes everything right
My topicthe redemption of Hip-Hop you got it
But I told you that this thesis is at least two sided
Can't just introduce Christ to the culture like an evangelist
The church needs to be schooled on hip-hop culture so plan for this
I'm a Christian admitin' were wastin' our wisdom
If we don't engage the streets, peep the nation of Islam
They promote a better culture and faith integration
But no resurrection or message of grace that can save men
So God's diggin' in the meeting place
Looking for those needing grace
To launch out from the over crowded breeding space
What will He find?
Just what He designedHip-Hop's got missionaries
He brought up for these times"
song-for-you,2005,ambassador,Hip-Hop,"(Hook)
People I want you to
stop toting guns don't shoot. Stop smoking blunts oooooohhh. I've got a song for you.
Syke!! Didn't think it was a slow jam, did ya? Didn't think it was an old man, did ya? I hit ya with Scripture, listen to every word I say. The rapper Ambassador's back like a vertebrae. Focused vertically, hoping for the day. When Biblical sense is more common than courtesy.
I envision this hittin' you in the barbershop. Lyrics rushing like wind like when the Spirit of God was
dropped. I can see them sisters in the salon.
Puttin' The Thesis on with some grease in her palm.
Dope tunes boom and they stick in your brain. So when I make a dope tune boom I slip you the name.
Jesus Christ, He wants to get in your frame. He owns it but you're like
homeless, you need Him to slip you some change. And when he does, guess what, life can't stay the same.
And when it does, guess what, Christ can't be to blame.
[Repeat Hook)
People I want you to
stop trading God for loot.
Don't leave this life a fool, I've got a song for you.
Lord, I don't sing but nothing brings more pleasure.
Than to offer you to awful dudes who worship that thing called cheddar. They've never read of your prophets, gospels, or letters. So, they don't know you're hotter than rockin' four sweaters. But that's the job of the Ambassador. Hit mics 'cause it's life after the casket door. You know the hood ain't used to them theological truths. Philosophers snooze; they think belief in God is for fools. And I'll admit the existence of God is harder to prove. But please believe that Jesus is God and you're cool. We can work on unpackin' the intricate plan. God understands, like women say about a sensitive man. Much sin's in a man, through Adam it got into the fam.
Makin' us all prisoners, like when you get sent to the can. And that's trouble like when Blacks bump into the Klan. But then a infinite hand went and sent us a Lamb.
[Bridge]
1, 2 and we you don't stop.
And we won't quit. If not for you, Lord, we won't spit. We do this for all the hip-hop heads, spit Christ cause He's life for all the hip-hop dead.
(Repeat Hook)
Yeah, you see we want to talk to the culture. I mean, why all the killin' and the fightin', and the fussin' and the drugs, when I've got a song for you.
[Verse Three]
Syke! Aaahhh, the rawness is back. Tell your boys the Lord uses the rawest of raps. The hardcorest of tracks cause hardcoreness attracts. Some hymns are not a good hook like a chorus that's wack. But He's sovereign he can take from the boringest camp, save a thug with the accordion and a Gregorian chant. That's why even though hip-hop is full of ungodliness, God can twist hip-hop around, really it's obvious. Got to be gospel, can't say, ""Really it's positive."" The rugged cross is the object that we've got to lob to kids, whether they catch it or not. The method is not the main thing long as the right message is dropped. Why not? You're actin' like this surprises y'all. The gospel's flex fit, yes it's one size fits all. From the murderer to the old lady who prays, to the man that's fit as a fiddle or the baby with AIDS.
[Bridge]
1, 2 and we don't stop, and we won't quit. If not for you, Lord, we won't spit. We do this for all the hip-hop heads. Spit Christ cause He's life for all the hip-hop dead.
(Hook)
People, I want you to
hunger and want the truth.
If there's no want in you,
I've got a song for you.
People I want you to
hunger and want the truth.
Don't leave this life a fool. I've got a song for you."
fall,2005,ambassador,Hip-Hop,"Sometimes I pause rappin' and wonder what all happened
Read Genesis 1stunner, you'll start clappin'
Read Genesis 3you'll see a fall that's been
Keeping us all flattened
Like what we would call backspins
Back thenthe fall was immediate
Sin enter in but as a foreign ingredient
It's getting worse
Man's livin' in a curse
Firstdifferent hurts
Then worse, he's endin' in a hearse
It wouldn't be so bad if
I ain't read those passages
And see so graphically that we were majesty
We were designed for rulin'
Could've caught us snackin' with a pack of lions just coolin'
I try to picture how it might be
Seeing life rightly, nightly getting' it in w/ wifee
No strife B
Just different paths that we'd site see
Chillin' like raspberry ice tea
(Hook)
I'm the living God and I made you
Though you've fallen hard I can raise you
Though your name's in lights
I see your pain and strife
And I'm the only God that can save you
I'm the living God and I made you
Even though you broke my heart I can change you
I can give you life
'Cause I paid the price
And I'm the only God that can save you
It was boomin'love between humans
They both loved God and they'd rush to communion
Seemed too legit to quit just like Hammer
Next scenewooopthey tripped and slipped like bananas
Now fast forward
The castyou're it
Can't ignore it
You're in ityou didn't have to ask for it
We're like the crack baby who got jacked way before birth
It sure hurts and that's crazy
Yet it's evidentwe're in Adamwe get a portion
Sin's inherited and we've inherited a fortune
Now the block ain't safe; dudes chop their weight
To make moves they've got to glock their waist
No love, they're so thug they would pop their race
The whole club scene is bugged and it's not so chaste
No love, they're so thug they would pop their race
The whole club scene is bugged and it's not so chaste
(Hook)"
oh-wretched-man,2005,ambassador,Hip-Hop,"Oh wretched man- the problem ain't that we rock Timbs
That I am- the problem is we've got sin
Who shall deliver me?- even with a new start
From this body of death?- we need to be freed, we need a new heart
Oh wretched man- the problem is not just behavior
That I am- the problem is there's rot in your nature
Who will deliver me- even with a new start
Our Lord- we need to be freed, we need a new heart
We're in a hip-hop era full of hip-hop errors
Not just the block but the heart's what hip-hop mirrors
Somebody told me that we're not naughty
I objected and directed their attention to the Top 40
We stopped at the top ten; looked how we propped sin
The case was closed when the videos were dropped in
From naked females to dirty sex in emails
It affects from retail down to the street sales- every detail
You can leave the heart unsupervised
Watch the heart ask for sin and ask the cashier to please super-size
Read Romans and peep your corners for bonus
Were gonna be wrong as long as were breathing- we need a Jonah
I serve word cause it's what the suburbs and the hood needs
Wreckin' the thought that heaven's earned by your goods deeds
I'm mad precise when it's the after-life
You bank on good deeds but you can't think this ""dis-counts"" like half the price
Sin is genetic it's
The reason your appetite for it is husky like that school up in Connecticut
Check the Bible for a honest diagnosis
Or just smell cause you can tell like chronic halitosis
We all sin- you know we each are prone
If only humans were affected then to each his own
But God sees it and it's reached his throne
In him there's no sin
Like there's no such thing as pizza bones
The spiritual truth- we have no spiritual loot
We're bankrupt and we have bad spiritual root
Every day we grow bad spiritual fruit
We need God to hold back that spiritual boot"

But don't forget about the blaze that the body sparks (the body talks)
Most women have care in their genes
Where's the care you killin' us today the way you're wearing those jeans
A few of us really care for the king
We've got to fight when you're in sight
For other men staring's no thing
""Well don't look then""
Well sis, I wasn't lookin'
But if I've gotta nose can I help smellin' the cookin'
I know you can blame it on the weakness of men
But the weakness is made weaker when we see your skin
Don't mean to offend but somebody needs to contend for sensitivity
Ok yeah the reason is sin
I'm not fakin' believe me
You're not makin' it easy
And I'm able to see the
Plot of Satan for sheezy
He's got us thinkin' it's easy
To watch the things on the TV
Then control the soul which gets inflamed when it sees these
Women who seem to think their body is free
Save it for your husband or maybe you're husband to be
Don't forget that the body talks
You've got to watch what you say with your body parts
We're in a day where they display the body art
But don't forget about the blaze that the body sparks (the body talks)
You're probably thinking I'm not any fun
Consider girl we're in a world where if you're 12 you look 21
Men teach your sons when he's young
Or when slimmy comes he'll feed the sweet tooth he has for her ""sinny-bun""
You know the logic- girls flaunt it cause they've got it
We want a project, yeah we wonder, ""Could we knock it?""
Sorry brothers I'm unpackin' the plan
Sorry mothers we love ya but we learn to mack from a man
Relationships we see are quick- a flash in the pan
Marriages that stick are few- like Blacks in Japan
Big bottoms have got a lot of men trapped in a trance
Their flesh causing lots of interest like cash in advance
If that was your plan it worked because you're all that
But all that says to us is that you might be faster than a corvette
Listen ladies I implore you to be pure
If not read Isaiah 3: 16-3: 24
But don't"
my-clothes-my-hair,2005,ambassador,Hip-Hop,"[Chorus]
So many people are hurt inside
Don't even know him even though they might have heard of God
Can He love me? Will He hear my prayer?
Or, think I'm ugly when He see's my clothes or sees my hair
I heard of a Savior heard He bled and died
We could give Him our sins and we could get his life
Yet I wonder for me if He will He even care
When He sees my clothes or when he sees my hair
[Verse One]
Let me get up in this verse right now
I'm thinking back to when we first got down
I only groped but when you searched I found
Snatched quick though you knew how I acted
That's what's sick, I was a pick that you drafted?
A backflip with a split couldn't be more backwards
In fact that's classic
I love to see your tactics
But I think back to when I'd shrink back on the real B
It's real deep; I really thought you could never feel me
Cause my shirts were double X when really I was a small
Double shirts for the effect when really it wasn't called for
Pants baggie- they sagged and dragged on the floor
But I was never that boy to show the back of his draws
But I did hang, kicked slang, me and my boys did
Rocked doo-rags till it put a crease in our foreheads
And on the surface others said we were worthless
But I'm glad you purposed to love us and you made us your purchase
[Chorus]
[Verse Two]
I was convinced of your power so I was down to comply with Your standard
Your God the Father- Creator- I was your product
But I noticed my focus it wasn't on You; my hope was you would
Meet me heaven but as for earth I'd roll with the hood
I really didn't want your heaven- just didn't want hell more
I really didn't want your presence- just didn't want hell more
I didn't know you were beautiful
You made advances but in fact I'd push you back like a cuticle
I was a bad date
But, now I know what it was you got lumped in with some people like a crab cake
They elevate their own; they celebrate
They make their own what's right
They say it's what you like
Everything else- they make it wrong
I'm glad you don't hate our music or fashion
Unless these things and how you intend us to use 'em are clashin'
Cause for us, this is just a part of the culture
But it's the reason why some think they shouldn't try to approach ya
[Bridge]
Man sees the outside
But God sees the inside
No matter your outside
Through faith He'll come inside (2x)
[Chorus]
[Verse Three]
I could weep
So many people never heard of the name
Yeah they heard the word ""Jesus"" but never heard of His fame
They feel cut off from Him
Not just cause of their sin
But because of their clothes, hair, or their color of skin
And they've been afloat- drowning in sin, we're in a boat
Yet they've never been approached
Cause we see them as different folks
God's offer's universal- yeah
He wants you in His circle- yeah
He wants you in the doo-rag
And He wants you in the purple hair
You can just take a cursory
Glance at the word and see
God made the plans of diversity
Is there one godly ethnic group
In the church should we all wear one polyester suit
Or maybe rock sandals and robes, no ham I suppose
When we meet maybe we should only eat salmon and loaves
Should we only like the organ or the violin
I'm inquirin', I admire men up in the choir and women
But one minute, why do some people assume that God's iPod
Got no tunes that got the ""boom-bap""
He's with White, with Black, with Lat
With Asian with Rock, Country, Jazz, with Rap"

get-you-open,2005,ambassador,Hip-Hop,"[Hook]
We goin' get you op... we goin' get you open
Ready or not I gotta tell you from the top it's on
Christ is God, for Him I've got to rock this joint
I was born around the same time Hip-Hop was formed
Vacant lots were swarmed, kids from the block performed
Soon cocky's norm
Rappers and cocky form
Went together like college and sloppy dorms
But the flows were butter like poppin' corn
And the shows would get you hyped like Rocky horns
Some couldn't understand why Poppy warned
""Stay away"" till the day when rappers like Biggie and Pac were gone
But prior Christ came and got me on
Taught me not to trust in the biological clock we're on
We're in the age where the caps are peeled
Even in school young guns'll have you runnin' like track and field
And life after the casket's real
And since that's the deal
His word gets spilled when I grasp the steel
Forget mass appeal my heavenly Dad can deal
With making His word something that all cats can feel
I'll let grace talk 'cause grace stalks the stray hearts
She's got something in store that's super like K-Marts
[Hook]
Do you see what I see?
Hip-Hop is a drug and it's got the city plugged like an IV
Gotta give it upit's the voice of the streets
It doesn't take muchjust a voice and a beat
You can keep a crowd hyper
Control the souls of a whole generation kind of like a modern Pied Piper
Face it; today ya favorite rapper's the icon
That's gotta hold on you like the wrap of a python
Lights onChrist is the hype jawn
For Him I've gotta get my write on
So whether in the streets or in the booth
I'm a get at you, and I'm a prove you don't need the gin and juice
Mommie you don't gottaDROP IT LIKE IT'S HOT
And if you do it 'cause you wannaSTOP IT LIKE IT'S NOT
Son if you like the gangsta mind... think of where them gangstas wind
[Hook]
Nix your smarts
I know one who tricks the smart
Slick's his art; his canvas is your wicked heart
You're in a spiritual fog and it's thick and dark
And like a spiritual frog you get picked apart
But I know One who'll fix the heart
Trust me he'll set you free like the girl from 106 and Park
So shine your light like when a wick gets sparked
And if you don't give him props then the bricks'll talk
We switched up, we switched the pitch up
The lyrical mixture is fully loaded with Scripture
But some are fancy and cute
When people can't understand
They say, ""ahh you just can't handle the truth.""
Nah the bad news is; while the gospel's an offense
lack of clarity and substance just adds to it
So leave out the trivial tricks
Moms and kids can both love itkind of like the cereal Kix

body-talk,2005,ambassador,Hip-Hop,"Don't forget that the body talks

Now I'm about to build a case like a lawyer
I need grace cause I'm a face heat like a broiler
But I assure ya, I'm for ya
Represent the only God who would die and he's not Sawyer
I'll slow it down I'm a walk for ya
You've been goin' round lettin' the round parts of the body talk for ya
It's a sad state of affair
I'm aware with the rear
Some of y'all have gone and made a career
Nobody is seeking a hottie that's highly indecent
Except when they wanna use the hottie for obvious reasons
Please know you're body be speakin'
I'm not talking about the kind of body talk you get from out of Ephesians
I'm talking about the kind you hear on the ave
Where starers be at
They sit back and ""mack"" just to stare at your back
I wanna help but it's in the blood stream of the culture
And some of you queens are so mean I can't even approach ya

It's been a while; I've been chillin'out, in and out of basements
You've been patientwaitin' for what's been marinatin'
God's a slow cooker
I know look how I'm stationed
Knee bones are bowed to the throne and now I'm facin'
Raised up stakes and a lot of anticipation
Allow me to shift the weight to the God who can get with Satan
If was a Colt you'd allow me to look to Payton
Well I'm William; now will you allow Will to look to grace and
Trust Christ to be the reason I feed them a true dish
Skills are only equal to probably barley and 2 fish
But Christ is known to whittle your stash
Till it's little and then he multiplies the little you have
Whether you laugh or not I'm a trust in His word
I dare trust the God who cares more for us than the birds
After I drop some'll ask, ""What just occurred?""
Ambassador was more than rappin' he was rushin' to serve
(Hook)
Amba-ss-ador
(Verse 2)
Hip hop is more than a musicmore than a fad
Like the church is more the pews and more than pastor
It's what the streets asked for when they fell through the cracks
They felt trappedhip hop gave them a back door
We were sheepthe streets were like pasture
We could feast on a beatwe liked rap more
At the core it's about art like a crafts store
The glory of God is what all of our crafts for
But like any culture without Christglass jaw
Easily robbed of its wealthlike cash draws
Now hip hop's in a peculiar position
Sides get divided by it like a tool of division
It can teach but not free you like a school up in prison
It can feed but it's usually junk food in the kitchen
And it's now in a ruler's position
Could go far; but the way things are the fuel's not efficient
(Hook)
(Verse 3)
I seem to love the culture but I hate most of its ways
I'm supposed to if I say I hope souls can be saved
It can make you gravitate to the foul spots
And make it look great to break all of God's ""shall nots""
All of your pals flock to the place where the shells drop
They sell rock and make it look like you're on hell's block
Gals shop just make mouths drop
Hard not to watch when you see what these gals rock
And kids are so star struck, forget Harvard
They wanna be on a show that hooks their car up
And you can hang God up
You'll blow the whole mood, they're gonna go ""boo""
When His name is brought up
But this is the mission Ambassador's on
This Christian is hip and he's rippin though its hazardous for him
I'm rappin' as long as I can till the chasm is gone
I know a God who'll put a Lazarus on them

back-home,2005,ambassador,Hip-Hop,"(feat. Karan Sabir)
[Chorus]
You, in the Maybach
Laid back with the wave cap
Make your way back home
You, in the Von Dutch
Louis Vuittoned up
Girl, your times up- come back home
You, with the corn rows and the long fros
Lookin' all swole, come back home
You, pretty princess
In the pink dress with the pink vest come back home
[Verse One]
I represent a people that fell through the cracks
Their creative- you can tell it from the wealth of their raps
They gotta story
Which some are known to tell on their backs
Or through graffiti
Others use music and tell it through wax
Take it back
I would cause those are relevant facts
But that was back when we were midgets on a elephant's back
But today we're the elephants that
Other people wanna stand on
We're no longer still in the back
But problems have emerged like the sellin' of crack
Kids'll put a shell in a gat
Then put a shell in your back
And there's a gap between Hip-Hop and the church
Leavin' them stranded like a rescue team stop to a search
But now it's on
That era's gone a new era's born
They never met Christ
They only met Farrakhan
Well it's changing cause now we're pickin' up the pieces
Expect to see the ecclesia givin' ya to Jesus
[Chorus]
[Verse Two]
We're all apart of the original fall away
In Adam we all fall and y'all it was all the way
Yeah we're lost
But the message of the cross has been bearin' fruit
But only seems to be for lost souls wearin' suits
Back in the day when my Pop's was growing up
Saved or not on Sunday your hind parts was showin' up
Forget it you headed directly to the steeple
Church was on and poppin' especially for the Negro
But today, Hip-Hop's got new affinities
Money, power, and sex, and a lot of new trinities
Church or the club?
They'll chose club life quickly
Look, you can find them in the club like 50
As for ushers I've seen theirs
He dances without a shirt and the guy screams, ""Yeah""
Plus they get to see Lil' Jon
It's ludacris if you think you're gonna see them read a little John
[Verse Three]
Peep God's people- called out of evil
We do more than hang under a steeple
Meet the lethal adversary call it the flesh
A new status but a body with old habits- all of it meshed
All with no rest we fight
Can't just do what we please
We're like kids and sin's like the new Chuck E. Cheese
So, we strive to give him all not just 10 %
Cause we're called to live life different not influenced
Instead we influence things
Been convinced sin ruins things
No longer them sensual beings
So it's gonna be tight
And it's on every night
But if loving sin is wrong, we wanna be right
So each morning we fight and tell the body relax
Don't feed the flesh and you watch how the body reacts
We've gotta read Acts cause it's an all out war
Kind of thing that you've got to be called out for

thesis-pieces,2005,ambassador,Hip-Hop,"[Verse 1]
Looks like it finally came around like the hands of a clock
Praise to Yahweh Nissi
Shout to the Banner Shabach
This LP is two sided for the man on the block
And for the flock who thinks keeping God's commandment is hot
On one side we wanna represent Christ to the Culture
Hip-Hop mostly knows Him for making tight little posters
Or a sculpture, but they can't view Him like they're supposed to
'Cause the gospel's never been preached to them like its' supposed to
And the life in Christ has never even looked like an answer
Except for locked up crooks and Big Mas with cancer
So, Ambassador is back to give you his thesis
The greatest need in Hip-Hop is the input of Jesus
[Hook]
It's the thesis we need this
The story in short
Hip-Hop properly submitted to the glorious Lord
It's problematic 'cause
It can be scary to like
But... Jesus makes everything right (2x)
[Verse 2]
My topic the redemption of Hip-Hop you got it
But I told you that this thesis is at least two sided
Can't just introduce Christ to the culture like an evangelist
The church needs to be schooled on hip-hop culture so plan for this
I'm a Christian admitin' were wastin' our wisdom
if we don't engage the streets, peep the nation of Islam
They promote a better culture and faith integration
But no resurrection or message of grace that can save men
So God's diggin' in the meeting place
Looking for those needing grace
To launch out from the over crowded breeding space
What will He find?
Just what He designed Hip-Hop's got missionaries
He brought up for these times"
we-worship-you,2005,ambassador,Hip-Hop,"I was made to worship and adore you enjoy you
Put you on a pedestal and lay there before you
The more you do work in me the more I can't ignore you
I've been in awe
Every since my inner man first saw you
Got so many names
We can't run out of things to call you
They're all true
These are what we ought to use to draw you
'Cause any picture of the immortal is skimpy
Even classic pictures by Leonardo DaVinci
'Cause you're the wise God
Immortal and invisible
And Jesus Christ is your only accurate visual
Every one should honor you just for your common grace
Good comes from you God
It's like wine and grapes
You're omnipresent
You protrude beyond time and space
You're holy
You're set apart like mom's china plates
You're showy
You got shekinah
And you shine your grace
You're an oldie
You go back like rewinding tapes
[Hook]
We worship you {*3X*}
Oh Lord our God
If not for you we would have been lost
Sin's boss
Until the day we met you at the cross with the Timbs off
Told all my friends paying for sins was not a slim cost
God had to become a man and go out on a limb for us
We need the blood that your Son shedded
Nobody else's works
It's like using diesel when you need unleaded
Good deeds won't stand like a man that's one legged
We don't have enough
Like trying to graduate with one credit
Jesus the Father was pleased to crush ya
Now we got a crush and want to be with you like girls wanna be with Usher
Some have to see to believe they need to touch ya
You bless those who believe without seeing we need to trust ya
You brought us through
But in the process you caught a few
Blows to the hands, feet, and the side
Your beard they tore that too
Fake gods fall short of you
That's why we find ourselves pantin' like the deer from Psalm 42

crown-him,2005,ambassador,Hip-Hop,"[Ambassador talking]
In a day in time
When hip-hop seems to be runnin' things on earth
It's time to direct it's attention toward heaven
Let's do this!
It's time to meet ya maker
[Verse One]
The story's over 6, 000 years so it's pretty old
Been rhymin' about it, gotta shout it my city's cold
Like the artic, this artist has thought of martyrs
To keep me going regardless
In light of the Lord of harvest
Any life given to Christ does get affected
You gotta realized this guy was resurrected
That's why my motto is Hip-Hop's got to acknowledge him
The God of men liver than David, hotter than Solomon
Better than Pac and them- Biggie, and Pun put together
His Throne set up forever- Son has got the credibility
Ill as He is, still got humility
One God- but persons are three like a trilogy
I'm tryin' to monitor is this beyond your mind or what
This kind of stuff enlightens you like when it's noon and blinds are up
I'm just tryin' to get your confidence up
When you hear his name this kind of response is enough
""AND CROWN HIM LORD OF...!""
[Verse Two]
All things everything, past, present and future
Broad things I'm talkin' the vast and the minutia
He's better than you in whatever you think that you're better in
Stronger, plus he's been doin' it longer like a veteran
These are the things I'm feedin'
Even the heathen can see Him in action
That's when they either leave or believe Him
Your career- He's controlin' it
Check the men who fished all night and caught nothin'-
Like a catcher's mit that's got a hole in it
Then he rolled up told 'em take the nets and unfold 'em
Cast the net, they gotta catch so big the boat couldn't hold them
Can't box Him in, You're looking for the top- it's Him
Beat Him, you'll never see it like me up in some moccasins
Many stories are just like this so I write this
Hip-Hop or not, you've gotta know who Jesus Christ is
""AND CROWN HIM LORD OF...!""
[Verse Three]
Your neighborhood or your block
Your mansion or ranch, your condominium
House on the lake or your yat
He's...
Lord over your writes, over your mic, over your booth the
Lord over you life, over your wife, over your mula
Lord of your acquisitions, Lord of your things
Lord of your chains, Lord of your watches, Lord of your rings
Deservin' worship- His word is a perfect law and it brings
Grace to the world universal- He's Lord of the kings
Hip-Hop- I'm tryin' to get you in your Bibles
So in your heart you'll prepare a place like He's doing for His disciples
Don't be alone, better have an aid
Satan'll have his way, plus your heart'll block truth like a barricade
This is to set it straight like when you calibrate
Out of babes He's established praise- why don't you have a taste
""AND CROWN HIM LORD OF ALL...!"""

But I'm way past caring

Trying to remember,
Nothing lasts forever
Live before it gets too late
On the never ever
Pretty good together

So if I touch her right thurr aint no need to get mad
I could take you from the club to paradise
Used to my chicks, I like them thick
Plus naughty and nice
The way you sweep me off my feet, you should be a broom
The way you smell, should of had your own perfume
So knock knock, who's there? Jackpot (that's hot)
Ran with the old head so fuck the sex

Make money with my partners as I murder my foes
In all black clothes like the Grim Reaper

Man I'm knockin' cowards off of my riders before me
Lay it down motherfucker and quit bumpin' your gums,
Ain't no peace in the slums just bums and crumbs

Police say G.I.B. is a game
But we hooded up doin' our family thing
Straight up hang and swing in the city of ?
Increasin' my change to an impeccable range

Of course I'm a beast on them tracks I release
Whether East or West, I envision a check
That my show pay, I'm a predator, hey
So where's my prey 'cause it's possible for me to be poppin today
I'll keep rockin' the ? in the home of your place
Bet you won't wanna stay
Keep the chrome in your face

Just visions of casualties, sworn to municipalities
Got 'em after me 'cause a coward chose to speak on how I eat

Like the ? brothers, leave 'em layin' between the sheets
See we Get It Boyz, so we roll with the heat
If money got a problem, tell him he goin' get beat

I'll put you lames in the place where you're eternally restin'
And for that player-hatin' testin', you gon' meet the Smith and Wesson
Cause these bad block niggas take no prisoners at war times
Respect mine, I'll have Guerrillas kickin' in your door time
We're deep with the artillery, impose on your spot
Plenty G's plus a silly G to get your ass-knot
Ridin' in a minivan, contraband in my hand
Find these buzzards, split their wig, that is my master plan
I don't start it but I finish it a true gun blazer

intro,2005,don-omar,Hip-Hop,"Un 5 de Julio del aÃ±o 1986
Llego al mundo Bull and Raice
En un pueblo de la costa norte de la isla Corl Carolina
El chamaquito conociÃ³ el lado oscuro de la isla
Viendo como los panas se mataban en el cacerio por kilo o por libra
A veces solo por poder o por guÃ­a
Y una noche sintiÃ³ una mÃºsica en el huesos
Y en su sistema sanguÃ­neo
Y el chamaquito entonces tubo esta misiÃ³n
Vivir de la mÃºsica brother no es imposible
Cuando de la mÃºsica es que deseas vivir
Any solo dream ya vivo en el siglo 25
Mami sin dinero, papi no es precinto
Y yo me acuerdo en las noches me pasaba pensando
AlgÃºn dÃ­a serÃ© rico o morirÃ© tratando
Pero ahora todo es diferente
Ahora le gusto a la gente
El que estaba pichando
(Lo digo mamando)
Su carrera esta en peligro
(Lo digo mamando)
Ahora no hay break
SeguirÃ© matando hasta que yo lo decida
MatarÃ© a to el que siga envidiando
Ahora no hay break
Me importa to correr lo que la gente diga
No me voy a quitar (Mientras siga respirando)
Tienen que aceptar la realidad
Que acabo de arrancar y no voy a parar
Y aunque hay un centenar que me quieran ver mal
Yo no voy a parar, no
Y hay que aceptar la realidad
Que acabo de arrancar y no voy a parar
Y aunque hay un centenar que me quieran ver mal
Yo no voy a parar, no
Ahora no hay break
SeguirÃ© matando hasta que yo lo decida
MatarÃ© a to el que siga envidiando
Ahora no hay break
Me importa to correr lo que la gente diga
No me voy a quitar (Mientras siga respirando)
Un 3 de Octubre de 1980 llego al mundo en el seno de una familia humilde
El chamaquito fue criado por una madre soltera
El chamaquito jamas permitiÃ³ que eso se convirtiera en una dificultad papi
El chamaquito agarro lo mejor que pudo de la experiencia
Y con la mÃºsica como norte
El chamaquito comprendiÃ³ si misiÃ³n en la vida
Que la vida a veces esta llena de depresiones tropicales
Y que never stop five and the level
Y dios no the raith papi
Ahhh
Jaja
Cuando empece en esta cuestiÃ³n fue sin mirar atrÃ¡s
Sin saber que el camino es duro pero hay que luchar
Con un entendimiento y mientras canto pasa el tiempo
Veo como mi carrera gira, oh que bien me siento
Ahora se, que lo que cultive ha rendido frutos
En absoluto no fue en vano como lo disfruto
Y solo es el comienzo (Colega me escuchas)
'Toy viajando el mundo entero, intenciones tengo muchas
Muchas puertas que toque, mil estudios visite
SentÃ­a que me quitaba, pero nunca me quite
Y aquÃ­ estamos, dos seres humanos que se juntan
Dejando de que hablar, hay muchas preguntas
Gracias al seÃ±or por la fuerza que me diste
La madre que me pusiste, la familia y lo que hiciste
Contesto sus preguntas con la dura realidad

Si el aire que respiro te adora

recompenza,2005,don-omar,Hip-Hop,"La recompenza es basta
Y la vida una sola
Vivir hora tras hora
Para morir y ser yo
La recompenza basta
Y la vida una sola
Vivir hora tras hora
Para morir y ser yo
(Eliel!)
Aveces uno se pregunta si la vida es justa
Porque mi vieja se tuvo que morir de cancer
Y no estar aqui conmigo viendome triunfar
Porque mataron a Georgie, a Charlie, a Tony
A Carmelo y a su primo Michael
Porque los mataron y los dejaron irreconocibles
Y los tuvimos que enterrar
Y llorarlos
Y hasta olvidarlos
Aveces uno se pregunta si la vida vale la pena, socio
Porque la vida en el caserio
No es igual a la vida en una urbanizacion cerrada
Porque Victor Fajardo se robo el dinero
Que era pa' que nuestros chamaquitos estudiaran
Y salieran del barrio con un diploma
En vez de un tiro
Porque a Pedro Rosello jamas lo pudieron vincular con el palo del pueblo
Porque hay falsos profetas alfrente de una iglesia
Y hasta les permiten tener programas de television
Porque sigue la guerra en el caserio
Y las AK-47, como lobos de una fucking noche interminable
Porque, seora gobernadora, el gobierno nos roba la fe
Y mata nuestras esperanzas
Porque hay que seguir viviendo encontrando tantas dificultados
Porque los domingos en mi barrio no son los mismos que en Torrimar
Porque Norberto Nieves pudo salir a la graduacion de su hijo
Cuando a miles de preso no se les permite
Porque Buzo esta cumpliendo en su casa
Y a nuestro hermanito Tempo lo tienen cumpliendo en la Federal
Porque hay guerra entre Estados Unidos y el Medio Oriente
Porque hay que seguir viendo mas odio, mas ira, mas ratings
Mas carceles, mas masacres, mas sueos rotos, mas lagrimas
Mas historias de superacion, de fabricacion de cargos
Porque vivir, mi hermano?
Sientate, que te voy a decir
Vivimos, porque la recompenza es estar vivo, papi
Me aferre de la verdad
Y adopte la realidad
Por que vivir no es por vivir
Si no vivir pa' superar
Y me aferre de la verdad
Y adopte la realidad
Por que vivir no es por vivir
Si no vivir pa' superar
Yo me aferre a que mi viejo me amara
Sin embargo, Edwin Otero lanzo su hija al vacio
Yo me aferre a creer en Dios
Cuando sus representantes en la tierra cometian lascivia
Yo me aferre a creer en la lealtad
Sim embargo en mi barrio hasta los primos se tiran trambos
Yo me aferre a que el gobierno fuera algo verdadero
Sin embargo, el gobierno resulto ser una total mentira
Yo me aferre a creer en la paz
Cuando miles de puertorriqueos son llamadas al field de la guerra
Y mueren por gotas de petroleo
Yo me aferre a creer que el matrimonio, segun la iglesia catolica
Es hasta que la muerte nos separe
Y sin embargo, viene nuestra gobernadora y se nos divorcia
Yo me aferre a que los jodedores de la calle no chotean
Y pal de cocorotes panas mias hicieron valvula en la Federal
Y a que se habran aferrao' los dos chamaquitos que salieron de la Grabiela Mistral
Sin saber que esa tarde morian en el Cerro Maravilla
Brother, yo me aferre al amor
Y estoy vivo
Este es mi testimonio

1980,2004,estelle,Hip-Hop,"Yo yo yo
I grew up in the 1980's
In a four bedroom house
My family, my grandma,
Three or four aunties
Uncles and brothers
In and out of prison daily
At certain times when there was no heat
We stay under covers
There was life like u never seen
Grandma taking extra people in
Come dinner time it was tippin' 18
Boil a big pot of water on the stove to take a bath
Rub my face with olive oil
All my mates used to laugh
All my cousin's moved out
We all got divided
As i started to get older I seen God providing
I've seen 50 pound last 3 months solid
I got my first pair of Nikes we were still eating porridge
Me and my cousin used to play Mel and Kim
Practising dancin'
Coming down the stairs and ting
I touched Africa and came back darker
Knowing myself
Feeling my roots a little bit harder
1980 Year that God made me
89 I started to get by
99 I started to write rhymes
Walk with me reminisce my life
So then we moved up
1980 Year that God made me
89 I started to get by
99 I started to write rhymes
Walk with me reminisce my life
So then we moved up
I thought I was the Fresh Prince
Dynasty was re-runs and Dallas was faded
With three beds this time and six kids
We got a doggy that dog loved to shit
My brother got his first pair of LA gears
He thought they were to take pictures of instead of wear
I started hanging out and my jeans got tighter
My weird neighbors set their own house on fire
Church was all day every day and every week
That's where i learned how to sing
Hearing that pastor preach
Benediction was all we went for
So we could run home and play connect four
Mum worked late and we learnt to cook
Rice peas chicken and stew pea soup
In the room watching Kung-Fu films
And Cleopatra Joans
Wishing we were Cosby kids and the match stick girls
1980 Year that God made me
89 I started to get by
99 I started to write rhymes
Walk with me reminisce my life
So then we moved up
1980 Year that God made me
89 I started to get by
99 I started to write rhymes
Walk with me reminisce my life
So then we moved up
The man downstairs was dead for three weeks
His own cat started eating him
The house starts to wreak
That's when we moved out
And our house was bigger
We had a large garage and the attic was killer
We used to pray for three hours in the mornin'
Sitting on the school bus
Believe we was yawning
All our hair was stuck down to our foreheads
Jam curls, splits, dorags and pin curls yes
Sexy boys walking round showing interest
In what I don't know 'cause we all had flat chests
Don't think we never mastered the kid and play steps
Doowop for days in the boggle yep
But this is just the beginning of my life right,
Nine kids a house and one life time
Yo, the beginning of my life right
Nine kids a house in one life time"

Fix up be real to yourself would ya
Sell yourself for a ring or a belt or a ki of drugs and a nine
Start blazin' 'cause your heavy and no-one can tell you nuthin
You're an idiot, life ain't real you should go to Iraq then talk about real
'Cause we only get one life and then it's gone for good
And you're the only one who seems to be stopping you
So when you step make sure it's true
And take your time I'm telling you
People we need to be
Free, don't think about being less than yourself
Free, negative people never good for your health

This is a dog eat dog world
But it belongs to the man,
But it's not without the love
Of a woman's understanding
Hurting ourselves for no reason that you have,
Was already yours, anyway,
If you see somebody I want you to smile instead of frown,
Just because they look angry
Don't mean they want to beat you down,
And it, don't cost you nothing
But you pay for a gun,
To kill our sisters and sons,
People we need to be

Girl have we drifted so far that we can't even talk no more)
Uh huh, listen yo
We can't talk no more blood
'Cause you never ever really understood blood.
My heart was open but you stepped right on,
You never thought that I was up for being number one, yep
How long I know you, we kept in touch through college.
Never the type to give you brain I'm giving you knowledge.
We be like old school,
I seen you fucking with some other birds. Yep
I let you roll right through.
Gave my soul to another home dude,
But you're calling me telling me your problems
And I was going through my own kind of problems
But ? you took a piss like you were care ?
Yup I had that there.
And now you're shocked when you see me
Wishing we were cool to talk wanting you to see me
Working out your numbers to call me, come and see
But you ain't real enough to see me, I'm making it clear babe.

It's so sad that we can't even talk no, we cant even no more

Girl have we drifted so far that we can't even talk no more)

And now I see I should have kept you at arm's length
I thought you changed from the past and then you make me waste my time.
Obviously, I got you wrong from the start
I should have never let it get that far
I can't deal with your attitude
Erase my number from your phone, I've had it with you
And it's so classic that you want to blame the whole situation on me
Now let's see, I ain't saying I was perfect
But you played your little games
Was it worth it
And everything that I did you deserved it
And these days I hardly walk out the door 'cause you blow everything
Out of proportion
I'm not surprised we don't talk any more 'cause you just played with my mind
But it's all good.
Hey girl I Love you so and
I'm so sad that we can't even talk no, we can't even no more

How do I stop myself from*
Falling in love with you
When I've already got a man that
Swears that his love is true
Oh you just can't tell me
This isn't anything
But the more time we spend together
The more that I start to sink
(Deeper)
This ain't love that's starting to make me fall
And if this ain't lust then I don't know what's going on
And if you fall I know where to catch you babe
I'm taking time, so I can say this the right way
Stop think and maybe,
We could fall in love, oh this is crazy
Leaving that other guy that called bye?
Heart feels like I'm bleeding inside, I could cry
Sometimes I catch myself,
Drifting off in your eyes,
Wonder if I need,
Something new in my life
For the all the wrongs that we're doing,
Can't seem to help myself
Somebody told me love was simple
Why is it causing me hell?
When I see my reflection in your eyes
My stomach gets butterflies
You can't tell me you don't feel this vibe
Athough simple, feels so nice
Stop think and maybe,
We could fall in love, oh this is crazy
Leaving that other guy that called bye?
Heart feels like I'm bleeding inside, I could cry
I know it's hard for it to end like this
But it means to be strong, just for one kiss
The way you carry on, it's like it's killing me
Nothing like a good home estability
But ain't just...
Something more real than my first man
Ho we going to do this situation,
Cause I'm starting to feel your impatience
In my lifetime I've seen no regrets
And every single step I take is correct
But we're getting caught up like milly jackson
Wishing I was back in the hood, chilling and maxing?
Hell all my friends say it's drama,
That I'm the one that told them about life and karma
If that's the risk that I'm taking it
Walls mean nothing to me, walls are breaking
When I see my reflection in your eyes
My stomach gets butterflies
You can't tell me you don't feel this vibe
Athough simple, it feels so nice
Stop think and maybe,
We could fall in love, oh this is crazy
Leaving that other guy that called bye?

so you wasted my time made me drive from the line,

you stole my pride
i'll make you regret for the rest of your life, yes i will, yes i will, yes i will

[Estelle: Speaking]
So I'm in love and I keep telling this guy and it's like he thinks I'm jokin every single time I tell him it's like
""Alright, OK. I love you to yea OK"" and sometimes you know when you don't know what to do
And your heart is just exploding and you look at them and it's just like
So I sing it like:
Wake me up in the morning with a kiss and make me some breakfast
And in the evening a candlelight dinner
Or when I feel restless
Give me a soft massage and my neck starts to tingle
Even when we didn't have anything you still made me feel like your queen
Now crystal and their glass is clean
Sleeping on on the floor,
You know what I mean
And I love you because you hold me down
When the world thinks I'm brave you see my frown
I love to be loved like this and I love and I love your kiss
So thankful
Yeah this is all I was trying to say to you:
You make me fall in love again
And I am so glad you chose me yeah
You make me fall in love again
All over and over again
[Royston:]
Your like my angel
Perfect for me, that's all I ever wanted you to be
Understand when you said that you loved me
What kind of man would I be if I told you I loved you constantly
You probably wouldn't believe me because your frontin like you don't even need me
Still I just wanted to tell, wanted to tell
You are my wife, my lover, my sister, I'm your brother
I feel you
I just wanted to tell you
[Both:]
You make me fall in love again
And I am so glad you chose me yeah
You make me fall in love again
All over and over again
[Estelle:]
Lovin you is like the song that I am singing
Like the snow and the stars and the sun and the conditions
Take it lots like the northern lights
Seeing you bounce my heart like the candle lights
I feel different didn't think this was me
I'm seeing wisdom, didn't think that this could be
I wanna kiss him got me being super girly
Head swirilng all because the love ain't hurtin
Thinking he was worth it
[Both:]
You make me fall in love again
And I am so glad you chose me yeah
You make me fall in love again
All over and over again

suicide,2002,avant,Hip-Hop,"Oh Lady,Since you walked out of my life
It feels like the world is just caving in on me
Damn, I can't live in these four walls all alone
And you know how much I love you
And how much I want to hold you
How could you do this to me
Girl since you closed the door in my face
Its been like a dark hall that has no end
I'm looking at this bottle
Gonna drink it till its gone
You might as well say this is the end
don't know what I'm gonna do
I don't know what I'm gone do without you baby
I don't know how I'm gone live without you lady
My life just ain't nothin without you by my side
It feels like suicide
Feels like I'm on a plane ride
Facing its final hour
I'm goin blind and I can't see
In front of the judge facing the death penalty
Lock and throw away the key
can't you see
I can't think, I can't sleep, I can't eat, feel so weak
I need you to rescue me
Take me from this misery
I don't know what I'm gone do without you baby
I don't know how I'm gone live without you lady
My life just ain't nothin without you by my side
It feels like suicide
It won't be long before I go down
I need you girl to come around
I don't know how long it will be
won't somebody come see about me
I'm on my knees praying to you
Gonna do something that I should not do
I just can't take this pain

sorry,2002,avant,Hip-Hop,"I know I was wrong and that's not fair
Playing games with your mind cause I new you cared
Walking out of the door every other night
And I knew two wrongs wouldn't make a right
Now things have changed
And what your feel is not the same
I thought we couldn't make ends meet
But you can't stand no more pain
And now I know pain and it is me
I'm lonely and here is where I want you to be
A woman like you is too precious to lose and I am confused
What will I do baby I love you and I'm

I never knew what true love was till you left me
And now the thought of you with someone else hurts me deeply
I tried to keep those thoughts out of my mind
But I'm thinking about you all the time
Where is our love, I must be out of my mind
What else can I do to prove my love to you
I'm going crazy baby and your love will make me
I never should have done you wrong
And now I'm sitting here all alone
You should feel my pain and for you I'll change
Can I have a second try cause with out you what am I

you-ain-t-right,2002,avant,Hip-Hop,"Yeah, it's just more drama, it's kinda funny,
Things you go through in your lifetime,
Sometimes you just can't explain it, well,
Do women do what men do, if you don't think
So, explain this to me, keep it real
Tell me where you were last night
I caught you in another lie
See you been creepin' for so long
You see I had this feeling (feelin')
That you ain't never been true
Shit you said you did not do
Confessions goin' down tonight (down tonight)
See you won't get a chance to me no more lies

You know you ain't right
Been livin' double lives
Creepin' on the low
You thought I wouldn't know
You know you ain't right
Been livin' double lives
Creepin' on the low
You thought I wouldn't know
But I know babe
See you mistake me for a fool
Thought you could walk on me like a shoe (oh no)
Steady carryin' dirt through this house
I gotta call that you were seein' across town
I never thought you stoop so low, never, never
This far I thought you'd never go, never, never
But like a card game you played yourself
Now play the game with someone else
Because you ain't right
[Chorus]
I know about the jeep with the chromed out rims
I know about the club and the late night meals
I know about the conversation on the phone
I know about the nights that you didn't come home
Cause you been livin'
And you've been givin'
And you've been creepin'
On the low, on the low
And I gotta let you know
It's all right, it's all right
It's OK, it's OK
Baby bye, baby bye
No more lies, no more lies
It's all right, it's all right
It's OK, it's OK
Baby bye, baby bye
No more lies, no more lies

Call on me,
Cause the relationship we have will never end
I will be your lover and your friend

I gotta get you home, girl pick up the phone
Or just 2way me, we can get away
If only for one night, can we spend the night
I want to change your mind, I want to make you mine
No more wasting time, please believe it

Girl please
Call me,
Baby if you're wrong or if you're right
It could be, morning noon or night
You can wake me up out of my sleep,
Cause you should never be lonely, baby

To all the haters in the club just stop it
'cause tonight ain't go be no blockin
I'm goin to give her everything her body wants from me

And ain't no mommies in here, were tryin to save

So you go be leavin in the Escalade, so tell me

A chick with a cost

Body look tougher in her jeans but greater
In leather get dress chose more whips
Than chasing the weather
So when it's hot top down
Stone beats forever baby tell me what you want for me
Poppin bottles of crisi
Rollin off exctasy
My clique is growin up vi
And when you next to me the world is yours
My city on lock so here's the key
Keep it movin haters faces tatooed
In a colorful gators with players
Throw your hands up if you gettin that paper

Tellin me come to the club got Av and the Gator
Holla later we out

Something wrong with the making love
Seems to be to me
You forgot what love was
Seems to be to me
Something wrong kissing
Seems to be to me
Something is missing
We had fun that year that you turned twenty one
You were my world
'Cause you brought me my baby girl
She so fine and she's all mine
And I promised to love you
Until the end of time
That's ok cause I felt the same way
But you're running game
And that's when everything changed
The phone calls and your two ways
And your attitude
You wanted too many pimp tapes
After all of the things
That we been through
I'm still willing to take care of you
Girl we been together for so long
And I just want to know, what's going on?
Seems to be to me
Something wrong with this household
Seems to be to me
You're always trying to take control
Seems to be to me
Something wrong with the kissing
Seems to be to me
You forgot what love was
Seems to be to me
Something wrong with the kissing
Seems to be tome
Something is missing
What happen to kissing and hugging?
Instead of all that cussing and fussing
I want to know right now
What you got to say
What happen to respecting me?
Instead of spending time in the street
I don't need to know; in fact I got to go
Wait baby let me plead my case
I got a faw more things to say
Shit is making me made
Girl what I do so bad?
What about that girl
You sending money to down the way?
What about, you been cheating on me
She had your baby?
What about, the lies and deceit
I face day to day?
What about, I don't feel the way I used to
I lost my faith in you?
Seemed to be to me
Something wrong with this household
Seems to be to me
You're always trying to take control
Seems to be to me
Something wrong with kissing
Seems to be to me
Something missing
Seems to be to me
Something wrong with the making love
Seems to be to me
You forgot what love was
Seems to be to me
Something wrong with the kissing
Seems to be to me
Something is missing"

Feeling like I want some more

You got me open like a liquor store
Love so strong that I don't want no more

You're like a drug girl you got me hooked
You're the queen I see in my dreams
Want to taste some of your ice cream

You're like a drug girl you got me hooked
My boys say I'm tripping but I'm like so
'cause you got me open I don't care who knows
When it comes to you baby anything goes
You're just like that drug that they smoke
You got my mind twisted and all tied up
From your conversation and gentle touch
Whatever you want baby never too much
Baby sit back and let me take a puff

Girl you know you got me hooked hooked hooked

When you touch me it makes me say oh lord
Girl you got every little bit of my soul
Making it hard for me to gain control

And tell me when your walking by
Can you see the tears in his eye
Somebody please tell me why
Why
Why does this world seem so cold
Just like a rich man who won't give a pot a gold
Why
Before my life comes to an end let's try to make amends and
Let's give it a chance
Tell me why
Baby don't know her fathers name
Mother's confused just the same
She's saying that it's alright
But she needs a father in her life
Somebody please tell me why
Just like the sand on the beach
Just like the ocean runs so deep
We all must take our part
And dig deep in our heart
But I don't know where to start
Someone tell me why

I bumped into, a friend of mine, and she told me where to go.
She said go right down, the 56th street, make a left at the corner store.
There'll be a house in the alley way,
Hope she didn't move away.
I pray she's still around,
But somebody came to the door that I didn't know,
And I knew to let it go,
Is it over, all over.

All the things that we planned to do.
Our wedding day, our house in the valley,
Maybe a kid or two.
We could've had it all babe,
But somehow it all fell apart.
I agree to take the blame,
See I'm feeling so ashamed.
I never should've lied.
I'd give anything (I'd do anything baby)
To see your pretty face again.
Hold you, to feel you,
Heaven give me one more chance.

And baby I miss you and I need you your love,

It could've been our anniversary,

If only it were possible,
For me to turn back the hands of time.
I'd do anything, give anything,
Just to make her mine,
I can't live without your love babe,
I can't go on another day.
Where did she go?
I gotta know.

Chemically glued tracks the ripper

day-at-the-races,2004,cut-chemist,Hip-Hop,"Yo, my metaphor, my musical madness
Move and motivate those with musical talents, uhh
Read it in bold print, we holdin' it down
Lick a shot, hip-hop when we in yo' town
Uhh, master blaster sound
Freak the future far from here and now
With style, release increase the peace, uhh
Bubble with the beat 'til they feelin' the heat in the streets
Now each one, teach one, reach one, young gun
On one, listen to the warrior's drum
Beatin' up the block with the ghetto hop that knock
And make you want to crash the spot
And unlock explode (boom) the alpha and omega code
With drum rolls and old soul, we uphold
And foretold to scores of six years ago
Fast flow from g. rap to cool moe
Supasyllable, major to the minimal
Every individual, bounce to the tempo yo
Lungs collapse and raps be trapped in
The only way to make it happen, jaw-jappin', fast rappin'
Yo, I'm the hot dog that run the hottest monologue
In star poetic inserts and yes y'all s
My speech is like holding two glocks apiece
The outreach that rock police
The super adventure men portend to put somethin' in bitches
Win when we write, the Emmy winner get hyped, off any printer
And I came to get it (hit it)
Like operation push, operate the tush
Black octopus of soul, in inter-planetary patrol
I planted my gold, and low and behold
It's the brother doc, ready to rock-rock
Don't stop hobbes, I known like the lumberjack chop chop
The wordsmith, I write in block letters of cursive
Curse my circus, serve this surface
And watch how the brother fet over
The fly Casanova with the frankincense odor
Bear witness
To where riches'll make career bitches share pictures
When the ears get this ya brainses software'll glitches
Splatter your brains
Leave scattered remains of matter and stains
That'll explain how you was battled and slain
I get rude and go, to your show and use a row
Of fans to boo and throw you off 'til you lose your flow
A pro mean like joe greene when I blow theme
Put your whole team on pause like cold cream
Then show laughter when I flow faster, your hoe haveta
Go after her weave from the breeze when I blow past ya
I'm dapper plus ghetto and just pedal
When the dust settles we left in the rubble the crushed metal
Nurses with hearses sealin' conversed with lit purses
Spit fire, make you first to bit, try me
Like Osama, odoma', I'ma cause trauma
And homicides when I collide I get kamikaze
Kane baby, walk hard, the p-jects
On streets of Brooklyn I'm a crew of d-cepts
On streets of l.a. I'm a whole e-set
On tracks with Jurassic I be the T-Rex
Still that Gucci dressin', still that coochie pressin'
My pimp game smooth be-gets 'em
I don't use discretion; cop tends to be stressin'
Fuck explainin' it, who's he testin'?
Finsta perform all physical forms
Leave your ass shakin' like a Mystikal song
Please dumb, what type of shit was you on?
Cause man to compress a nigga mean one less a nigga (uh-huh)
All I want is my niggaz all recruitin' a slimmy
All I want is my liver all polluted with remi
Duel with any, bring it, I face-off
Son you out your league like Jordan was with baseball
Yeahhh, your majesty, word flash photography
Third class economy, blade slashed your artery
Nerve gassed anatomy, blurred past dramatically
Herbs hashed, my word splash packed agility
Never predictability
Maneuvers of mind fully designed cause I'm true to the rhyme
We do the sublime, crackin' yo' backbone
Attackin' you wack clones
Vernacular right and exact, capital rap zone
That come back verbal assault rifle (ahhhhh)
We fight like Stokely Carmichael
Nope! we just like you
We broke and ain't no tellin' what we might do
Ain't no joke
Provoke the right to reverse to seek mercy
With the king Asiatic and Percy P
Ain't heard the worst of me, until your chest 3-d
Spit venom and burn your body like a std
Put a twenty on the next brother steppin' to me wrong
I mess around a lick cause you done cheat on my theme song
This might seem wrong, but this is a mean song
Crushed like king-kong, and just like ping-pong
Back and forth, I spit knowl' and toss, it's time to floss
My verbal affirmation is to always go off
When syllables slide you'll be enjoyin' the vibe
When consider it pride, it's J5
When another deadly medley, camera action yo we heavy
Aim steady slash machette Maserati engine ready
Good and plenty don't be petty count the fetti and we jetti
Off to another city where we do our nitty grity
We wild like Serengeti, tear it down let's seek and set it
Get ready, for the ride, verbally hand-glide
Write and stay tight, mission's in sight

You more confused than tiger woods when he made up cabalaysian

If you want it I got it, come get it I'm with it
Your career will be shorter than a midget
And the world will know who did it
I smack up these ho ass MCs like a gorilla pimp
You comin' out the box like a gimp, money you still a wimp
My shit blow out filaments and light fixtures
With the right mixture of words used as colors
To paint the right picture
Graphic masterpieces your whole shit is smashed to pieces
Make you look at your man who rhyme and be like, ""you not nasty like he is""
Believe this when you see this, and don't fuck with
Me either, 'cuz you'll be down where my feet is
Curled up in the fetus
Cryin' from the kicks, watch when I flip
People gonna be buyin' my shit like fiends dyin' for a hit, so
What you wanna do? I'm runnin' through your front line
Your whole plan is catcha tan in my sunshine
One time 'cause it's some kinda wonderful
Don't stand there lookin' stupid, what you wanna do?
What you wanna do? I'm runnin' through your front line
Your whole plan is catcha tan in my sunshine
One time 'cause it's some kinda wonderful
Don't stand there lookin' stupid stupid"
soul-rebels,2000,dj-hi-tek,Hip-Hop,"We don't live for Hip-Hop, It lives for us
It's the eternalist, y'all burn to this, blaze da dro'
Soul rebels trap up, we got a long way to go
Before this here blow like a volcano
We get eternal, this is what you waitin' for
You try to front and play the role
When you more like a pimp who pay the ho
With my name up in your mouth like fellatio
I lace the flow on purpose even up the ratio
Of Hip-Hop to that shit they drop on the radio
Underground classics is what they used to say before
Now we break the surface quiet like an alligator nose
They hate it, cuz they know if they don't get it, then they may be slow
We still gonna blow like the horn played by Horatio
The stakes is three feet high and risin' like De La Soul
So I got Wonder Why, my man Dave and Maseo
We all got babies so we embrace the taste of dough
But y'all already know so I ain't gotta say no mo'
(De La) is whatcha need, (Reflection) is whatcha need
We got the masters of the ceremonies
Blessin' emcees (lip professin' emcees)

Yo! I'm homegrown for the bain, once I rock the mic plain
It's the extravaganza we glad you came
Made only for them heads, it's infra-red Aim
For such a world figure, we got figures to gain
(don't sleep on a nigga)
I ain't Icabod Crane get that ass cooked hard cuz we raw like Kane
Been known to mic spit, infinite per frame
While these girls throw me plenty like jenny to jane
Ain't some old school G poppin' memory lane, been on it future robotic
Since the day I came
If you don't know Plug Wonder Why is my name
Most recognized leo with my size in mane
Matter a fact track is simple and Plain
Cuz the complexities I freeze is too deep to detain
Reflect, Kwa-Tone Tek eternally in the game (and De La) oh fo' sho'

When we come into the jam we do it wildstyle
Y'all think these challengers is here to make a man fold
Shoot I've been holdin' these joints since I was day old
Came to confirm the fact that I've been on the payroll
Stay cold til one day make it hot and fade old
Continue til I'm dyin, rottin' out gray and old
I told them fool before they pass they have to pay toll
While I've been sittin' at the table eatin' steak whole, side of greens
Baby yams you know it stay soul, pre-natal
But they want to come spit your way so
So was I supposed to go and say no
Right emcees some walking straight, some take the gay stroll
I get my man to clamp they asses like they staples
I'm from LI we take it far as out as naples
And scrape hoes who'll be willing to take clothes off (off)
See once you bet it all against reflects eternal
You lose every rapper on a dept

memories-live,2000,dj-hi-tek,Hip-Hop,"Yo, you know what we got to do, man, we need to get a whole cd
Get a collection of all the music and everything we've ever done
Bringing back sweet memories
Life, living in flatbush and going to house parties
Red lights, bumping, life is what you make it, then sorry
In my lifetime, ain't done too many things
Better than watching your first son put his sentences together
Yo, it kinda make me think of way back when
I was the portrait of the artist as a young man
All them teenage dreams of rapping
Writing rhymes on napkins
Was really visualization
Making this shit actually happen
It's like something come through me
That truly just consume me
Speaking through the voices of the spirits speaking to me
I think back in the day, I absorbed everything like a sponge
Took a plunge into my past to share with my son
Bringing back sweet memories
Like thoughts out the back of my mind
Going back in some time
Like when you used to cut and had to go to the back of the line
Look back and you find
Tracks that make you relax and recline
Now cats rap about packing a nine
When they lacking divine
Inspiration
Running out of topics of conversation
Well I drop it in the pocket because rocking's my occupation
I do it remarkably, spark up a leaf
And possibly you could follow me
Tap into your chi
Utilize your memory
To help you see clearly, then get back to me
Actually, nothing's new under the sun
So when life be stressing me
My remedy is 'bringing back sweet memories'
Like the faces that are woven in the fabric of my consciousness
From cities where making 21's a big accomplishment
Like when my people understood their prominence
And my past life visions of the continent
Like the first time I saw krs live, rockin' it
I heard resurrection by common sense
Dominant in my psyche
I chose my direction like spike lee
To speak my life through mics, and I never take it lightly
It might be something you did to bring you down when you were high
But that karma's a bitch, you steady asking god why
Like when my parents first split up
Yo, I was illin'
Seems like some years they was together for the sake of the children
And I love them for that
I don't know if they saw that
So I'mma say it, and convey it when the world play it (3x)
Bringing back sweet memories
Like black is beautiful, names from the seventies
Let me tap into your energy
Fields of dreams become my property
When I reach my destiny like a prophecy
Especially when I 'm 'bringing back sweet memories'
I got deep into my mind, see I got a treasury
That float through my head like a sweet melody
What you telling me
Reflection is a collection of memories
Definitely this is how hiphop was meant to be
Eventually, I knew I'd run into hi-teknology
It was only a matter of time like centuries
Check the recipe or technique to how it sound so sweet
I freak with word power, my man speak with beats
If I could make it in new york, I figured anywhere I'd make it
Came to cincinnati linked with mood, and we did sacred
Hi-tek beats became my favorite
Hustle on the side was the cut
We started to put songs together like 'what!'
Traveled the world, came back to the crib
And hit the motherland
Yeah, this year we put in work and got some other plans
In fact, that's where I'll take the fam
When the reflection joint is done
By the time you hear this, I'll be basking in african sun
Like wow!
We made it
We here"
love-language,2000,dj-hi-tek,Hip-Hop,"Yo, we're going to have the word love
In many different languages translated all through the track
So, whenever you hear the word love
Know that, it's going to be in a different language
The language of love cannot be translated, yo
Love is blind, you just see bright light
You up in the club feelin' the night life, lookin' for the right type
Blood rushing to your heart making it beat
When she swept you off your feet and made it complete
You know the plan you had to conquer the world
Thinking you Scarface, looking for that perfect girl
And now you found her
Started with romantic, then got to frantic
Then things that's normally small become gigantic
Now y'all sinkin' like the Titanic here come the panic
Bein' with you like a habit without you I can't stand it
It's tragic when you wonder when you lost that magic
Without understanding that you never had it try to grab it
In the bed gettin' a nut off, communication cut off
Getting mad cause you turned or wondering where she shut off
Constantly comparing you to someone in my past
We don't smile anymore, and we argue over cash
Advance to that physical shit
See what happens if you keep talkin'
See what happens if you lay a finger on me motherf
Yo, see what I'm sayin'
It's like one big mind game that everybody playin and
Niggas say bitches is trife, bitches say niggas is
We just don't understand our fundamental differences
I'm still learning though, actually
I just do what come naturally, naturally, naturally
L'amour n'a pas de, frontiere (Love has no boundaries)
Restes car je t'aime comme tu es (Stay because I love you as you are)
J'ai traverse l'ocean du verbe (I crossed an ocean of words)
Et je t'ai trouve (And I found you)
Women thrive on emotions, men refuse to acknowledge
So when we arguin nobody win
Words get in the way time and again
Sticks and stones break your bones words break your heart
Whether you in touch with that part or not say ""word""
Words are weapons for the revolutionary
Used for evil make the situation very scary
Word up, but love is brave
It flies in the face of fear
Yo, wherever you want to go love'll take you there
Let's go, you know a flower that grow in the ghetto
Know more about survival than the one from fresh meadows
It got love for the sun, that's where I'm comin' from
Spit in this fashion cause I love rockin' over drums
Word (te quiero) I put my love into my music
If you with me then you love how I do it
If my heart you're livin' in your ocean I'm swimmin' in
Never drowning got me floatin' watching you in slow motion
Love potion overdosin' approachin'
The explosion of my senses everyday without your heart
Is like a sentence in jail
Trust I'll always be mentally free
You got the key to let it out I'll show you how it could be
Love {*different language*} it ain't nuttin' but a word
A chicken ain't nuttin' but a bird
Yo, yo, yo
L'amour n'a pas de, frontiere (Love has no boundaries)
Restes car je t'aime comme tu es (Stay because I love you as you are)
J'ai traverse l'ocean du verbe (I crossed an ocean of words)
Et je t'ai trouve (And I found you)
Some of y'all in love with that material but
Love enter my life like a miracle and
It reciprocal that's why I'm feeling you love
We exibit our natural behavior
Like making love under the moon in Jamaica
Get you so hot you call the name of the creata
The morning we hop back into action again
Up on the wall lovin' how the sun blacken your skin
Remember when we explored the beach
Swam in the ocean and saw beneith
How the colors of the coral reef looked like the illest floral peice
That's what your beauty remind me of
It's hard to find a love like ours, taking it high above
Them other duns try to spit game but, I dont sweat it though
Know in my heart that we connected so I let it go
Now if they call you out your name and that's a different thing
Anything but Queen I'll go to war like a King
Your friends sweat you cause you ain't got a band
But they don't understand
Some things is meant to stay between a woman and man
And they ain't privy to it so they try to get into it
Both you and me see through it so the way we flow is fluid
We speak the love language, they speak from pain and anguish
Some don't love theyselves so they perception is tainted
Out they joint like ""Shit, he payin for your rent"" missin' the point
When you rub me into your skin just like an ointment
It's more than pillow talk, it can't be translated
Learn how to speak it, and become emancipated
It's a language
Universal love
L'amour n'a pas de, frontiere (Love has no boundaries)
Restes car je t'aime comme tu es (Stay because I love you as you are)
J'ai traverse l'ocean du verbe (I crossed an ocean of words)
Et je t'ai trouve (And I found you)
Love love love love, love, love"

africa-dream,2000,dj-hi-tek,Hip-Hop,"These cats is no match, plus they lack a certain knack for rapping
They never catch the wagon like Re-run and ""What's Happening""
Since back when they had potty issues and snotty tissues we been rockin
Think you poppin next year nobody will miss you
My thoughts is too advanced for the artists on these labels
They come sweeter than sabal and softer than mashed potatoes
I tried to told you the rhymes run over emcees like Land Rovers
Took 'em back in time like Sankofa, Sankofa
We stand over the Atlantic, looking broad like a man's shoulders
The fire is trapped in a belly, ready to pop like canned soda
We outlasting, from middle passage
Touched down in New York
Cincinnatay! Big Ohio status what you thought
Money it's classic these bastards try to treat us like cattle
So life has been a constant battle, battle
Rising above the crabs in the barrel
Way too used to living in death's shadow
We stay on point like the best arrow, arrow
We hit the target accurate
Star shit, back it up
When we hit town, y'all niggas pack it up
That's how we get down, straight smash it up
Like a whip, hydroplaning
Hydro on the brain and maintaining
Game changing into subtle shit, we remain blatant
Yo, got to tell you to your face
You get replaced in this game, by Kweli
Place the face with the name
These cats drink champagne and toast to death and pain
Like slaves on a ship talking about who got the flyest chain
We the reflection of our ancestors
We'd like to thank you for the building blocks you left us
Cause your spirit possessed us
Yo, you blessed us
Thank you very much

With a, passion for heat you get, blast in yo' seat
Die before you crash in yo' Jeep, never passion in your sleep
Like an old man, you ain't a fool you got a whole plan
To conquer territories like Europeans who stole land
The future of your whole fam' hang in the balance
You the king, and your block is the palace
Y'all niggas is the parliament, untouchable, spot unrushable

Exactly what I thought, NOTHIN, in the sport of frontin
You the undisputed champion, I'm in a class you can't be in
My words is flesh like Jesus, the aquarian
It's just a chapter of the night, in the ghetto afterlife
Where you just seen or heard about or gonna have to fight
Where they sacrifice the life and niggas see flashes of light
When you trapped up in the heights but clappers aimin at the wife
Yeah, dudes gettin money is still thuggin
Chicks gettin money is still ghetto
Still livin the whole thuggish stilleto
Your team let the metal burst before you take an L
You raised in hell, let the dust settle first
Then you ask the question, snatchin the life of the innocent
Shit happens huh, a man's respected by his actions
It's the karma of the street, you try to meet the karma
While the karma sleep, yo it's deep, but the karma can't be beat
You don't know your enemy, so you fightin with yourself
Relate to rap niggas cause they writin what you felt
You got top shelf connects you gettin seasoned like a veteran
We suck the venom out the snake bite, without the medicine
We benefit from niggas in tenements, dyin for benjamins
So bad that they know they own coffin measurements
Ghetto eloquence, in the moment of truth, don't be hesistant
Or fall victim to the element, word is bond

You fakin the part of gangster, til niggaz break in your spot
You straight bitch whether I say it or not
Shit is hot, spittin flames on the track
Put our town's names on the map
From now until we fadin to black
Where we at? Thug rebels love metal clubs ghetto
When the slugs let go like Frankie Beverly
Forever we stack notes like the treasury, flow heavenly
Get you high on speech laced with obscenity
Niggaz be gassed like Cipher Sounds, and need rescue remedy
Then fall the fuck off like limbs affected with leprosy
One, two, three, four
Why the fuck can't MC's MC no more?
Hardcore til somebody put me under the ground
With a dick in your ear, still couldn't fuck with my sound
One, two, three, four
Takin me straight to the weed spot, then to the liquor sto'
""Gimme Some Mo'"" like Busta Bus', who do you trust?
Swingin through, your favorite neighborhood lush
I'm I-rate, usin your body for live bait
Xzibit rockin them heavy gems you can't take
Dilate, cock back the weight, spread hate
Heavy metal we settle and set shit straight
Hit gates in my younger days, from the policeman
Me and my clan used to dance thicker than quicksand
Supply and demand the hand is quicker than the eye
Find some chickens to fry, while you find it hard to stick to your lie
I see through the tricks, destroy the facade
Your little lungs is too weak to hotbox with God
Rah Digga, First Lady of the Flipmode Squad
Gotta be hard like a young nigga walkin the yard
For the first time, we ain't the niggaz you let shine
Expect mines to blow lines like coke everytime
I'm an Alkaholik nigga so I finish the fifth
You at the front door bitchin because you ain't on the list
It's like
One, two, three, four"
too-late,2000,dj-hi-tek,Hip-Hop,"Yo, when the bass thump, the place jump
Like it's way crunk, yeah
Fake punks get they face lumped
Sent to the most high, by the most fit
You gotta do, fuck that almost shit
The fam is close knit
You diggin', know the clock don't stop tickin'
Glocks still spittin', the whole block politickin'
Like presidents with they minds dead on arrival
Leaving no evidence of a struggle for survival
Songs relevant to the times like the psalms read in the Bible
Stepping to this leaves thoughts in your head 'it's suicidal'
It's the T to the A-L-I-B the deep rooter
Rolling with my wanna battle cats who chief buddha
And see through the overspecialized, underpressurized
No lie texturized, emcees who got the masses mesmerized
With empty rhetoric, they better quit
Niggas so hollow that they echo like sentiments
Nowadays rap artists coming half-hearted
Commercial like pop, or underground like black markets
Where were you the day hip-hop died?
Is it too early to mourn? Is it too late to ride?
Kwa is chillin', Tone is chillin'
What more can I say, we stay building
And make killings
Take children through the wilderness, by the hand
It's a great feeling, show 'em how to be a man
Exactly, pack trees in my khakis
My sound fat like a Neve while you thin like a Mackie
C'mon, shine so bright when I walk by
You got ta squint like the motherfucking sun in your eye
What! Say somethin, you stay frontin
It ain't nothing, let off like I'm big game hunting
Me and Tek stay way blunted
Wave running on beaches with white sand
With a slight tan
Smack the mic stand with my right hand
When I'm excited
Leave you so far in the dust that you forced to bite it
On fire like property lost to riots
Yo, ain't no stopping us when we all united
Nowadays rap artists coming half-hearted
Commercial like pop, or underground like black markets
Where were you the day hip-hop died?
Is it too early to mourn? Is it too late to ride?"
good-mourning,2000,dj-hi-tek,Hip-Hop,"What's the meanin of ghetto fabulous
Not ridin the back of the bus
I'm a revolutionary antagonist
Some playas is mad at us for just doin our music out of love
Some underground heads is hatin cause we have fun at clubs
I'm probably on some government list for my rhymin
You a fool if you don't think they already tapped your line
Medicine is big business so my remedies is herbal
It's music is for the people so we Reflection Eternal
Listen, you hear the difference between science and science fiction
We blow it out like if you leave on every appliance in the kitchen
at once, still rolling kind bud in Cuban blunts
On the corner watchin how kids comin to Brooklyn for they fronts
Niggas run past what they need chasing after what they want
Fuckin chumps, you walk down the street and get jumped
Brooklyn cats like to bubble out of town no lookin back
When you a ghetto chef you mastered the art of cookin crack
Some get caught sleepin on the Mother City so when they go
They come back as tales of niggas we used to know
Never looked up to see the stars in all they heavenly glory
Just straight ahead cause the peripheral is buildings with mad stories
Not floors but dramas is played out, shorties get laid out
like respect and fade out like TV sets
into the banks of our memories (let it be) we'll never forget you
Lyin on your deathbed askin for God to bless you
Good mourning, good afternoon, good night
What have you done with your life?
Everybody time comes to be embraced by the light
You only scared to die when you ain't livin right, man
I'm puttin up a hellafied fight
I need you all to be clear on exactly what I'm sayin
With your attention span I understand that I ain't playin
You mistaken if you somehow think it's just me you facin
Starin me down while your enemy is standin adjacent
My heart is racin but I know just what I stand for
We chasin death carelessly like +Jessica+, I +Care Moore+
Who said, ""Just because no one can understand how you speak
don't necessarily mean that what you be sayin is deep""
In case you die in your sleep you ask the Lord for a blessin
Sometimes they sneak up so quiet that the silence is deafenin
You'll never know who the assassin is until it's your time to go
Your life is flashin, askin for forgiveness but you move too slow
Now the people that you love bear the pain that you once harbored
You was livin for yourself so you could never be a martyr
Life is hard, death is harder; you somebody baby father
Someone's lover, son of your mother, somebody brother
Somebody nigga, now your spirit in the air like a whisper
Hearin your name mentioned when we pourin out some liquor
The days go by quicker and the nights don't seem to differ
It's gettin cold, so I shivered and asked my soul to be delivered
Good mourning, good afternoon, good night
What have you done with your life?
Everybody time comes to be embraced by the light
You only scared to die when you ain't livin right, man
I'm puttin up a hellafied fight
Yo, the time come for everybody
It ain't somethin' you can really prepare for
Yo, yo, Mad Duke, rock rock on and
Curtis Mayfield, rock rock on and
Grover Washington, rock rock on and
My Aunt Hazel, rock rock on and
Big L, rock rock on and
Freaky Tah rock rock on and
Jerome Green, rock rock on and
Slang Ton, rock rock on and
We celebrate life"

Get 'em up, get 'em up what
Get 'em up, get 'em up what
Yo, yo, yo
What's with the melodrama?
Fella's wanna hover in my cypher like a helicopter
Like it's a special honor
The stealth bomba, gem droppa
Make the ghetto holla, inter-conta-nental
Takin you high like sky divers
When we spark with live wires
Original, cavemen quest for my fire
Express my desire to drop this new shit
These record executives keep tellin me y'all stupid
Now if they right, shut the fuck up!
Revolutionaries throw your guns up
Whether you a bourgeois broad who actin stuck up
Or some ignorant thug motherfucker shootin the club up
We gonna make y'all feel this, break y'all spirit
If y'all fake that realness, word we bringin it
Ringin it in from the new millenuim to way after that
I call these cats reynolds cuz they plastic wrap
Kill all the yappin lets make it happen
You cats ain't real, you just a re-enactment
Better yet, dramatization
Soon as the director say action you start fakin
I start breakin
The whole joint start shakin
This ain't the time or place for you to prove something
Cut the stargazin' yo, move somethin'!
Move somethin' (move somthin)
Move somethin' (move somthin)
Move somethin' (move somthin)
Move somethin' (move somthin)
To be continued
Lets see what's next up on the menu run up in you
Lyrics that be fuckin with you
In the mental, pick any mental, instru, funda, detri
Extra extra large like the borough of brooklyn the residential
Exi-stential-ist specialist
Like sly stone wit my poem and fly song
Ride along with cats who live great and die strong, word
We gonna rock till nothin else matters
Y'all catch bodies, we catch excellent cadavers
Your next of kin an' shatter stories splattered in the tabloids
Erase your trace like your cotton mouth and we pepperment altoids
Step in the high reppin the spot called flatbush
Whether rappers or actors you still feel the gat bust
The abstract then becomes the reality
Alcoholics like to call it the moment of clarity
Kill all the yappin lets make it happen
You cats ain't real, you just a re-enactment
Better yet, dramatization
Soon as the director say action you start fakin
I start breakin
The whole joint start shakin
This ain't the time or place for you to prove something
Cut the stargazin' yo, move somethin'!
Move somethin' (move somthin)
Move somethin' (move somthin)
Move somethin' (move somthin)
Move somethin' (move somthin)"

Right away hey, I put you under the sand
Right away hey, right away ho oh
Right away hey, I put you under the sand
Moi j'rappe avec le coeur, Ã©coute ce couplet
Si t'es criblÃ© de douilles c'est que tu chantes comme un poulet
Tu rap avec le boul
T'approches pas d'mon panier, plus d'3 secondes dans la raquette
Et 92 bastos, boom, se dirigent vers ta casquette
La rue te fascine, la rue te prend, la rue te calcine
Ma racine c'est l'argent facile
Mon rap c'est une montÃ© d'adrÃ©naline, une mauvaise blague sur ta mÃ¨re
Pas besoin de la brigade canine pour sentir qu'tu pues la merde
MC t'as trop trainer ton cul sur les banc de la fac
J'vais faire un manteau d'fourrure avec les poils de ta chatte
D'un patron j'aime pas recevoir d'ordre

I'm not the type to commit it then go admit it
Find yourself on a shelf somewhere in the city
And tighten it up with my belt to flood through your fitted

Dont bother nobody let's just step on my toes

au-fond-de-la-classe,2005,booba,Hip-Hop,"Mais qui je suis? Le type au pur style impeccable
Le mystÃ©rieux et stylÃ©, du type non rÃ©plicable
Le marginal, dit criminel lyrical
DÃ©trÃ´ne en masse les vaginales MC's, dans les bacs tous Ã  fond du cale
D.R.Y dit le pur sang, j'Ã©pure
Nique sa mÃ¨re le rap cÃ¨-fran, 100%
Issu de la banlieue sud
LÃ  oÃ¹ Ã§a te butte avec ou sans micro et Ã§a seulement par habitude
Magnitude 9,4 sur les ondes
Attitude adÃ©quate, je veux mes plaques, baise la BAC qui fait sa ronde
Thunes abondent autant que la mort, plus Ã  chaque saison
L'heure de l'homicide sonne toutes les heures
Les vitres t'aveuglent, s'efface l'horizon, mission
Atteindre les cimes du rap car la mort nous dÃ©cime
EncrÃ© dans le ciment, la joie hostile aux hommes entraÃ®ne le crime
Le doigt en l'air pour ces shbebs en bleu marine
Booba Intouchable tu bandes mais t'en fous pas plein les narines

Ouais gros, ouais gros, ouais gros, ouais gros, ouais gros, ouais gros

Fais pas ci pour nous, tragique pour vous
Nous les flingues et les tass on aime les faire crier pour vous
Six pieds sous terre, je suis Ã  la Cicap
Le monde est stoned on dit les Psy4
Il faut que j'en parle avec ma bouteille de Jack
Je suis au micro, c'est trop michto, ghetto c'est promis
Ordure, attaquant hors-pair, attachant comme une drogue dure
Ma vie, mon rap, son frÃ¨re siamois
Faut m'en mettre une dans la cervelle si tu veux te la faire belle, crois moi
Se pourrait-il que le crime soit dans nos gÃ¨nes?
Mes lyrics te font pleurer, j'ai la rime lacrymogÃ¨ne
Trop facile pour B2O, prend celle-ci dans les gencives
On risque la prÃ©ventive pour avoir le biffe d'un joueur de Chelsea
Nos rÃ©alitÃ©s sont leurs cauchemardes
Ils veulent Ã©duquer nos fils, applaudissent les colons dans leurs poÃ¨mes
Flingue dans la bouche du prof, poing levÃ© Ã  la Jessie Owens
Je suis allergique au shmits, pas au pollen
Mon rap est froid comme un Ã©paulard
Laisse-moi me dÃ©foncer au cognac, Hennessy sans Coca-Cola

Intouchable et Booba, y a rien Ã  faire, y a rien Ã  faire, frÃ¨re
Comment t'exprimer ce qu'on ressent, quand t'es jeune tu dors dehors
Squattes les caves la oÃ¹ Ã§a pue, Ã§a sent le symptÃ´me d'une vie hardcore
Quand t'as faim, pas un joint, aux yeux des gens t'es rien
T'as rien, pour rien tu pourrais tuer en fait tu deviens comme tous ces gens
Que gamin tu mÃ©prisais, en combattant des enculÃ©s
Tu peux devenir sans t'en rendre compte toi-mÃªme le pire des enculÃ©s
Ma vie, un film d'horreur, de drame, de guerre, de bals
Mon corps s'emballe, au cÅur j'ai mal, trop de potes Ã  moi sont tombÃ©s sous les balles
Au final j'en porte les marques mais dans les unes des autres se dÃ©marquent
Du ghetto j'en ai sa marque, ses halls, son dÃ©pÃ´t et la BAC
Le bÃ©ton gris m'a endurci, gros m'a rendu plus fÃ©roce
ÃlevÃ© au sky, au spliffs, dans ma tess j'ai vu des scÃ¨nes atroces
Faut pas grand chose, juste un mot, un regard, tu peux t'en prendre une
Dans le contrat y a aucune clause qui dit qu'on fume pas pour des thunes
Le jour oÃ¹ je partirais, une part du ghetto s'en ira

Petit la race humaine est mÃ©chante
Je suis venu, j'ai vu, j'ai vaincu ces chiens, la queue entre les jambes
Et j'ai toujours la larme Ã  l'Åil, le cÅur engourdi
Dis leur que j'suis noir et blanc, 100% bountykiller
Talentueux mais tu seras jamais dans ma poule
Sur le plus haut trÃ´ne du monde, on est jamais assis que sur son boule
Des fois j'me dope comme un coureur cycliste
Quand se rÃ©veillent mes cicatrices, j'me sens si seul et si triste
Lyriciste agrÃ©Ã©, pour Ã§a qu'Dieu m'a crÃ©Ã©
Sisi, ambiance pendus, ambiance Mississippi
J'me dÃ©chaÃ®ne, au microphone c'est l'Amazonie
Des indigÃ¨nes dans les chromosomes, les citÃ©s d'or, ma terre promise
Bras levÃ©s, tÃªte haute, j'ai rÃªvÃ© que j'mourrais au combat
J'veux pas mourir sur scÃ¨ne
Le ciel sait que l'on saigne sous nos cagoules
Comment ne pas Ãªtre un pitbull quand la vie est une chienne?
Bras levÃ©s, tÃªte haute, j'ai rÃªvÃ© que j'mourrais au combat
J'veux pas mourir sur scÃ¨ne
Le ciel sait que l'on saigne sous nos cagoules
Comment ne pas Ãªtre un pitbull quand la vie est une chienne?
J'en suis oÃ¹ j'en suis, malgrÃ© tellement d'erreurs
J'suis trop en avance pour leur demander l'heure
Pas Ã  pas, de pied ferme, sans savoir oÃ¹ j'vais
J'ai souvent cherchÃ© la merde, je l'ai toujours trouvÃ©e
Devant les profs j'faisais des grimaces en tirant sur mon oinj
Car on m'a dit en classe que l'Homme venait du singe

je-me-souviens,2005,booba,Hip-Hop,"Hop hop hop, hey, tu t'en souviens ou pas?

Avant Michael Jackson et l'arrivÃ©e de la drogue
J'me souviens quand les nÃ©gros n'Ã©taient pas Ã  la mode
Parait qu'on puaient, qu'on Ã©taient pauvres, le zen Ã©patÃ©
J'me souviens des yen-cli d'coke, le zen Ã©clatÃ©
Ã 10 ans en GAV, j'suis c'qu'ils appelent un vandale
Un peu plus tard comme Joey Starr, j's'rais un Boss of scandale
14 ans, mon premier joint, ma premiÃ¨re foufoune
20 ans, j'suis en prison, mahliche, la roue tourne
J'me souviens du mitard, de ceux qui s'ouvraient les veines
Des Manouches, des Beurs, des Corses et des Ritales
Mentale irritation, mon hÃ©ritage, le coeur vide les cohones pleines
Le futur nique sa mÃ¨re pourvu qu'Ã§a paie en espÃ¨ces
Mon premier bolide, R19, 16 soupapes
Course poursuite avec les keufs, plaide coupable
Ma premiÃ¨re vitrine, ma premiÃ¨re victime
DestinÃ© mon premier hit, single Desert Eagle
J'me souviens d'l'annÃ©e du forum comme si c'Ã©tait hier
Quand j'avais dehors salit la dinde, que Hihlia f'sait pas la priÃ¨re
Tu voulais test, fallait pas, on te massacre
T'aurais des flashs de quelques haches, quelques macaques
Aujourd'hui, beaucoup parlent de la street
J'ai fait ci, j'ai fait Ã§a, ouais cest Ã§a
MC sincÃ¨rement tu fais pas l'poids, t'as jamais priÃ©
Avant d'sortir un disque, nous on s'rappelle pas d'toi
Te souviens-tu ta premiÃ¨re gifle, ta premiÃ¨re casquette?
Ton premier jugement, aller-retour en boite en taxis-basket?
Ton premier KO, premier 16 Ã  l'assaut des ondes hertziennes?
Ta premiÃ¨re go ta-ta-ta premiÃ¨re chienne?
Ta premiÃ¨re pote-ca, ta premiÃ¨re rotte-ca?
Ta premiÃ¨re heineken? Kennedy, B2O

Avant d'sortir un disque, nous on s'rappel pas d'toi
J'me souviens mon premier Lacoste
Quand toute la France dansait le mia comme Akhenaton
J'passe mon temps Ã  m'bagarrer Ã  l'Ã©poque
Parc'que le soir mon daron cognait ma daronne, s'prenait pour Mic Tyson
12 piges, roule l'spliff, la vie a un gout d'pisse
16 ans, la rue a remplacÃ© mes parents
Capuche sur la tÃªte j'traÃ®ne dans les rues du 94
Je souris jamais (jamais), la vie m'a mis des grosses claques
J'me souviens la K'1 Fry Mafia, Mansa, Lasna
YÃ©zi l'escroc m'a fait croquer des scal-pa
Entre bagarres et gardav', la vie a fait d'moi une caillera
J'ai eu un flingue avant d'avoir un portable
Oh, j'ai vu la drogue ravager le quartier
18 ans, c't'annÃ©e, 3 potes Ã  moi se sont fait canner
Comme chaque rabzouz est nÃ©-nÃ©-nÃ©-gro
J'ai l'instinct de survie dans l'ghe-ghe-ghetto
Au lycÃ©e, les surveillants viennent me voir pour pÃ©-cho du popo

the-story,2005,bun-b,Hip-Hop,"Say, this is the realist shit I ever wrote or I said
Wake up with it everyday and take it with me to bed
Hurting my heart and hanging over my head
'Bout the realest nigga these Texas streets ever bred
see L Butler better known as Chad or Pimp see
The closest homeboy that I ever had
Now when we first met, we wasn't on the same page
From pettiness understandings that got cleared up with age
Two young boys who was ready to mash
Put P A on the map and maybe make a little cash
Jumped down with Big Tyme, put down a few songs
Everybody co-signed saying that we could do no wrong
Then hit the streets with a big ass bang
Them gangsta ass rhymes with that country ass twang
Dropped, ""Tell Me Something Good"" took off and went live
Shit, next thing you know we was signing to Jive
Dropped, ""Too Hard to Swallow"" ""A Pocket Full of Stones""
Put the remix on ""Menace"" shit we had it going on
Got, love in the streets and played on the air
But the homey putting us out, wasn't playing too fair
Had to separate ourself, bring in a new team
But sometimes the other side ain't always what it seems
We dropped ""Super Tight"" a album full of killer flows
But then we got caught up with the drugs and the hoes
We didn't realize what was happening on the real
And new management was cutting back room deals
Hiding different money and concealing the price
He had us doing all the work but was keeping the biggest slice
Took a while to catch on, to what homey was doing
But by the time we did, all the paperwork was in ruins
Nigga kept all the receipts so we couldn't file taxes
The next thing you know, IRS hitting us with axes
Pimp you owe seven figures, Bun you owe six
Better get your paper together, get this shit fixed
Remixed the management team and tried it ourself
Cussed out the GM, almost got put on the shelf
Fuck it, dropped ""Ridin' Dirty"" instant classic in the South
Reclaimed the southern title, shut everybody's mouth
Got some clout in the game, boys calling us the greatest
But meanwhile me and Pimp is still ducking haters
The old manager calling and say he fina' sue
And put a padlock on the everything we trying to do
Put a call out to the Prince, this nigga still hating
We got heat for the streets, and we can't keep the people waiting
He made a call to [Incomprehensible] and folks, telling the man
You gotta cut UGK some slack understand
Young Pimp got the plan, Bun got the drawl
Rap-A-Lot had our back and we just waiting on Jive
We got the big bosses on the same page
So me and young Pimp went hit 'em from center stage
Next thing you know we got this call from the N.Y.
It's Jay-Z saying y'all niggaz getting fly
He doing ""Volume 3"" and got a track from Timb
And wondered could some trill niggaz rock it with him
Shit big Bun was all for it, but Pimp wasn't sure
But ""Big Pimpin"" hit 'em 187-Pure
Number one song on every station you turn on
MTV and BET we getting our burn on
Grammy nominated can't believe that we made it
And we got a call from Jive that left us all faded
And it stated, that due to the success of the track
We here at Jive records, would like to piggy back
Get another beat from Timb, then get a verse from Jay
Let Hype shoot the video and we'll be on the way
Shit it sounded okay, but me I had to ask
If we don't do Big Pimpin 2, would you still put us on blast
A song like that might take a nigga to the top
But my true fan base, might think a nigga flop
They got mad and put niggaz on hold
For damn near a year till the buzz got cold
So we said fuck 'em and went back to the basics
Trying to find ways to get the fuck up out the matrix
We put ""Dirty Money"" together and it was aces
But that's around the time that Pimp caught two cases
He got probation, said, ""Fuck you hoes""
We finish the album, got ready to do a couple shows
And then he violated, one month before we dropped
And shit just got put on hold or fucking stopped
Now 30 days done, we back to the nitty-gritty
Album got released, big showdown in Chocolate City
Niggaz with masks on, vests and all black
It's Christmas 2000 and 1, bitch we was all that
Strongest on the block, nobody could budge
And then he violated, now we right back before the judge
They calling him a nuisance, put my dog behind a fence
It was January 28th, he ain't been home since
Threw a nigga through a loop and caught me in the crosses
Standing cold, CEO, now I'm the fucking boss
Had the devil on my back, got to drinking and drugging
Had to make a choice, get back to rapping or thugging
So I walked into my bedroom, got down on my knees
Put my hands together and I prayed Lord please
Let me get past this bridge over water that's trouble
And get back up on my grind on the double
He said son don't worry 'cause it's not really hard as it seem
And I can turn your nightmares back into dreams
You just got to stay true to yourself and succeed
Then push away from the devil and get closer to me
And every since that night man I promise I been on it
Giving that killer flow to anybody who want it
Pimp the pen like never before, I'm breaking 'em G
Not to mention I got the world screaming free Pimp see
So soon as you make parole and they open the doors
You ain't gotta worry about nothing, the world is yours
Ain't no mo' struggles my nigga and no mo' stripe
I kept it real because to me it's UGK for life"

But I'm always willin' to share the firepower on the shelf
I'm shiny star spanglin', ding-a-ling danglin'

I'm College Park rangerin', Houston, Tex mangerin'

Bun B, UGK sho nuff ladies and gentlemen
Got me some bread, made some paper
Costly fabrics, minks and gators bitch I'm balling

Got diamonds on my chest, keep me looking good)
Got me some bread, made some paper
Costly fabrics, minks and gators bitch I'm balling
(diamonds on my chest, keep me looking good
Got diamonds on my chest, keep me looking good)
Before I jump up out my silk sheets, and hop off in the shower
It's already understood, I got the money and the power
I grab the baby powder, under shirt and white tee
My Dickies, fitted cap and white one's that's me
A hundred karats worth of rocks, courtesy of Johnny
I roll a couple blunts, and load up the Tommy
Ready to get my stunt on, my pockets on swoll
Now all I gotta do, is see which car I'm finna roll
Now I can take the Benz, or I can take the Rover
And if I pull the Bentley Coupe out, then it's over
But I'mma keep it O-G, and pull out the slab
So I can sit on buck, and have some wood grain to grab
Last but not least, before I pull out on the scene
You know I gotta po' me up, my oily cup of lean
I've been stacking all this green, now it's time for some spending
I've been cool about this grinding, but ain't no mo' pretending
Got me some bread, made some paper
Costly fabrics, minks and gators bitch I'm balling
(diamonds on my chest, keep me looking good
Got diamonds on my chest, keep me looking good)

(diamonds on my chest, keep me looking good
Got diamonds on my chest, keep me looking good)
Now if you see me in the shopping center, walking down the hall
It's already understood, that I'm buying out the mall
I got six homies with me, and at least two freaks
Man we looking for the Louis, and the Gucci boutiques
I keep the flyest footwear, and the newest Locs
And if I get some'ing for me, I'm getting some'ing for my folks
Cause we all gon be fitted up, we all popping tags
We all walking out of this mall, with big bags
And I ain't gotta brag, you can see it for yourself
I got ballers on my right side, and ballers on my left
We ain't from the same hoods, but it's all to the good
We bout getting this money, like some real G's should
And we ain't knocking nobody's hustle, why plex man
You only hate on yourself, when you hating on the next man
You can't be like Bun B, so why try to
Get your own bread, and you can ball just like I do
Got me some bread, made some paper
Costly fabrics, minks and gators bitch I'm balling
(diamonds on my chest, keep me looking good
Got diamonds on my chest, keep me looking good)
Got me some bread, made some paper
Costly fabrics, minks and gators bitch I'm balling
(diamonds on my chest, keep me looking good
Got diamonds on my chest, keep me looking good)
Before I pull up to the valet, and hop out of the car
It's already understood, that we buying out the bar
It's a line around the corner, people trying to get inside
But a playa like myself, is finna walk right by it
Now move the velvet rope, and keep the scanner
You don't wanna see us angry, like we David Banner
2000 and 5, Tony Montana haters
Ain't no need for you to knock us, just congratulate us
We done made it out the ghetto, by staying on the grind
We focused on the paper chase, with money on our mind
Now we just wanna shine, buy some bottles and pop em
So if you see niggas out there, playa hating then stop em
Cause we don't really wanna have, to bust a motherfucker's head
We just wanna holla at bad bitches, and spend this bread
We buying everybody drinks, and making it rain
Cause I'mma rep, like a motherfucking underground king
Got me some bread, made some paper
Costly fabrics, minks and gators bitch I'm balling
(diamonds on my chest, keep me looking good
Got diamonds on my chest, keep me looking good)

i-m-fresh,2005,bun-b,Hip-Hop,"I say gentlemen, ladies, bad ass, out of control babies
It's the return of the bad ass perm pimp ya heard
Ya boy Fr-Fr-Fresh, Fr-Fr-Fresh
Fr-Fr-Fresh, ay
Bitch it's the king of the trill, I'm top of the line
My paint is on drip, my rims is on shine
My butter seats reclined, cherry oak is grip
With see to blow, and purple rain to sip
Now straight up off the rip, I'm letting boys know
I've never been a bitch, don't plan to be a hoe
So if you got some plex, you better keep it low
I bring it to your chest, soon as you hit the do'
You know me as a pro, respect me as a vet
I put it down befo', you ain't seen nothing yet
My candy still glossy, my four's still flossy
My rocks real icey, I'm looking kinda bossy
And feeling real saucy, it's time to get it crunk
Now watch me pop it fly, just like I'm popping trunk
The leader of the pack, the star of the show
When Bun is in the building, you already know
I'm Fresh, brand new
Every time, that I come through
Hoe look at my wrist, my neck
I just bust me a fat ass check, hoe
I'm the man, he's a wimp
If you wanna get ahead, get a pimp
Dope boy shoes, big rings
And only bad bitches say my name, hoe
Bitch you wanna roll with a pimp, then have it on your mind
It's all about this bread, so you gon' have to grind
I gotta stay on shine, so you know what that means
You gotta hit that track, and bring me back that green
Cause daddy need his ice, and daddy need his chain
We gotta keep it G, so rec' him as the game
A hoe need a pimp, a pimp need a hoe
And tricks need us both, so let's go get that do'
In case you didn't know, I haven't been told
But pussy on the corner, and it's as good as sold
It's tricks on the prowl, so stay out on that stroll
Cause I'ma sell your cot, and you gon' sell your soul
My pimping way too cold, but it's gon' keep me warm
With minks up on my back, and rocks up in my charm
So bitch ring the alarm, and tell 'em I've arrived
The greatest ever born, that's dead or alive
I'm Fresh, brand new
Every time, that I come through
Hoe look at my wrist, my neck
I just bust me a fat ass check, hoe
I'm the man, he's a wimp
If you wanna get ahead, get a pimp
Dope boy shoes, big rings
And only bad bitches say my name, hoe
Bitch you know that Rap-A-Lot's the click, and UGK's the fam
It's middle fingers up, 'cause we don't give a damn
Them Caddy do's slam, that top gon' drop
Them four's gon' tip, them blades gon' chop
Them deuces get chunked, them screens gon' fall
It's Southside holding, so we gon' ball
And slabs gon' crawl, them 3's gon' swang
That woman gon' shine, that trunk gon' bang
And underground king, from P.A.T
I miss my dog, so free Pimp see
And I'ma hold it down, and rep for my team
To keep us on the map, so he can get that green
I work the triple beam, electronic scale
Even a baby bottle, whatever get that mail
So Mannie please tell 'em, the motherfucking real
Why Bun coulda be, so motherfucking trill
I'm Fresh, brand new
Every time, that I come through
Hoe look at my wrist, my neck
I just bust me a fat ass check, hoe
I'm the man, he's a wimp

late-night-creepin,2005,bun-b,Hip-Hop,"Well when the moon comes up and the sun goes down
And the street lights start comin' on in the town
When the kids go insideand old foks go to sleep
That's when real G's come out on the creep
Midnight movin through the city on the low
Sippin' on some sizurp and smokin on some dro
Got the TVs on, both my screens on flow
Pop trunk on dis bitch and I'm ready to go
You never know what the night might hold
At the hour of the fungus actin way too cold
You see work gettin bought, and work gettin sold
If you real you can roll, but if you fake you might fold
Now a days its a struggle to survive
Some of these dark alley ways will eat you alive
I'ma grip my grain, and cock my gun
And show these mother fuckers how its done
When your late night creepin.....
'Cause we don't come out till after dark
With nothing less than 28 grams of spark
And nothing less than 16 ounces of sip
Everytime that its time to flip
You can find me
Rollin through the hood leanin in the lac'
With a woman on the front and a fifth in the back
Haters on the prowel on the one time peepin'
We don't give a fuck we just late night creepin'
In the late night
That's w, that's w,
That's when real G's see come out on the creep
I got my two 4-5s and they loaded and locked
Keep em' both on cock for I step on the block
It's the grave yard shit 'cause we out on the grind
And we don't care about time 'cause its money on mind
We the first ones out tryin to get us some bread
We ain't worried bout sleep fuck goin to bed
We the last ones to leave after hittin them stangs
Take it back to the boulevard with four's on swang
I do my thing and you can't tell me different
Cross the wrong line and your body might skip it
I'm programmed automatic with this G shit
And that go for every other cat you see me with
Glock turned on with the burn on the hip
I'm blowin on the deuce by the candy painted whip
I'ma grip my grain, and cock my gun
And show these mother fuckers how its done
When your late night creepin.....
'Cause we don't come out till after dark

In the late night better get your face right
Everything sells, bitches to the bass pipe
I seen it all eyes redder than a brake light
Blood shot 20 20 through the gauge sight
I'm in a gold lac bought it all from sold sacks
I ain't braggin homie these are just the cold facts
We known to hold gats and nobody hold back
Fuck a cheap shot I'll take out your whole back
So bring your whole pack better bring an extra clip
Ain't nobody walk away 'cause ain't nobody give a shit
Bitch I'm livin and I love it it's beautiful
Somethin like the smell of crap when I'm watchin your noodle blow
We famous pharmisuticals and breakin the bits
We blazin two up in the cuticals to breakin the bread
Don't give a shit you never heard of us
We known among the murderous
For toatin heavy metal push the good shit pour the purple up

This is the, the underground, the, the underground
The, the, the underground, the, the underground
Now this one here for everybody out there off the top
This for the real slab swangas whipping dubs and drops
For the real block huggers that's embracing the grind
And the three time fellas that be facing some time
For them real deep boys that be baking and serving
And them real hood hustlas that be shaking and swerving
For them real cut throwers putting work in on the average
And trill ass niggaz living they life like a savage
A lot of niggaz hold it down for they set it
And when the work comes easy and when the game ain't ready
Niggaz they really rep they're neighborhood good or bad
Niggaz that really be on the block throwing signs and flags
Well, I'm here to represent for all the gangstas and the thugs
And the underdog niggaz that ain't getting no love
For a nigga trying' to make a weight for him and his crew
Just recognize, I'm representing for you, and nigga that's on the true
I'ma sell my dope, I'ma bust my guns
I'ma fuck my hoes, I'ma stack my ones

Now, everybody wanna act like they already got it made
With the houses and the cars and the bills all paid
Got a million in the bank and two million in jewels
But on the cool, life ain't like that for a lot of these fools
Lot of people in this world coming up pretty hard
Raised in project apartments, with no front yard
Had to share their clothes and shoes with cousins and brothers
Never had they own shit, they had to share it with others
I wasn't born with a silver spoon sticking out my grill
I was raised in the middle of the struggle on the real
Had some hard times in my life, trying to make ends meet
Not to mention, trying not to fall victim to the streets
Against the odds, a nigga made it out the game
But that don't mean that I'm gunna forget about from where I came
UGK ain't just a name, it's what a nigga is
I was there before I got in the biz and nigga that's on the rizz
I'ma sell my dope, I'ma bust my guns
I'ma fuck my hoes, I'ma stack my ones
What I represent?
(The, the underground, the, the underground)
What I represent?

I'ma smoke my good, I'ma sip my drink
I'ma grip my grain, I'ma drip my paint
What I represent?
(The, the underground, the, the underground)
What I represent?
(The, the, the underground)
Now people always be around when you shining and balling
But they real hard to find when tough times come calling
You got money, doing good, and they be all in your face
Then disappear like Sue Storm soon as you catch a case
It's like clockwork homeboy, the shit never fails
Soon as they think the party's over, everybody bails
Could a sworn they was your friends when your world was on shine
But soon as you get some time, outta sight, outta mind
It's a shame that some real ass niggaz took a fall
It's a shame how they treat you when you locked behind the wall
When your woman won't visit and your homie won't send you no flicks
Or come and see you, that's some cold ass shit
Well I miss my nigga, he was down for me
That's why I got the whole world screaming,"" Free Pimp see""
And I'll be right here waiting when you touch back down
UGK we still holding the crown, kings of the underground
I'ma sell my dope, I'ma bust my guns
I'ma fuck my hoes, I'ma stack my ones

pants-on-fire,2005,buck-65,Hip-Hop,"Sky diver, your pants are on fire and the rest of your clothes is blowing
And for some strange reason, your nose is growing
My skin is crawling, everybody's chin is falling,
Jaws are dropping left and right
Lost cause you came like a thief in the night
With nice white teeth and a tight ass and long conversation
Fascinating feeling to spend months in your company
I never felt uncomfortable, even with my clothes off
Chillin' so hard, my ass almost froze off
Everybody shows off and wants to look presentable
But the fact of the matter is that accidents are preventable
From the sound of the candy wrappers
Down to the handicappers
Everybody's got to exercise a little caution
But every so often expect things to get hectic or
Technically difficult and I begin to get skeptical
Especially when the Canadian bacon gets sizzlin'
Isn't it a sin when the ceiling is invisible
We need new inventions that reveal peoples true intentions
A portable pride protector, affordable lie detector
The wild lifestyle has the tendency to intimidate
But it isn't your invitation to imitate
In front of my face, you spoke my gospel like an apostle
But on the other side of town, you got coke in your nostril
Just for example, we all want to live a bit
Whatever, it's your body of water, why should I give a shit
Who are you anyway, and where did you come from
Dumdum, just when I thought I could trust someone
The mask comes off, and your face fades away
You radiate eighty-eight full shades of gray
Black and white rainbow, you know you ain't acting right
Game show hostess, stabbing every back in sight
The time has come thicker than blood
And make no mistake, I'm a stick in the mud
I'm a kick in your pants and I'm a lump in your throat
And I'm the hassle in your castle, I'm going to jump in your moat
Splash, hypocritical condition the hospital
Makes this mission impossible
Pretty much, I've got no patients left and as a physician or doctor
It puts me in an awkward position
No magician can trick me, or lick me with a cattle whip
So what makes you think you can sink my battleship
We ain't family, drama queen, the camera's rolling
Show me your swollen memories before the moment's stolen
Slow-motion Picasso, wearing the wool socks
And coming with the full clip, I'm sick of this bullshit
Who are you anyway, and where did you come from
Dumdum, just when I thought I could trust someone
The mask comes off, and your face fades away
You radiate eighty-eight full shades of gray"
roses-and-bluejays,2005,buck-65,Hip-Hop,"I'm a lot like my dad I would have to say
He's been wearing a beard ever since mom passed away
She would have hated it
Inspiring he likes to go to church to hear the choir sing
Roses and Bluejays
Winner comes game over
He's in the driveway removing snow with a flame thrower
Drives a hard bargain, knows how to get the deals
Spring fever hits he needs a new set of wheels
Every year it never fails
Roaming around in his home town beachcombing
Roses and Bluejays
I'm a lot like my father
He knows he should go to work but sometimes
He doesn't bother
Reads books of every sort
And gets all the news he needs from the weather report
The door stays open a few days and closes
What's more important than blue jays and roses?
Son of a gun, the old man is something else
In addition to being a bullfighter and magician
He's a lazy river, slow moving train
Future hall of famer, playing through the pain
He's a grizzly bear
And do you know one time he even saw a UFO?
My dad's favorite things are roses and bluejays
I'd say we're the same in more than a few ways we're
Full of beans and big ideas
'Cause I can't sleep I'm not sure why he is
Wide awake and off to the races
Out of gas and lost in space so

Out of gas and lost in space"

is three times that of a normal human
Askin' silly questions like I'm their personal mentor
All they care about is my big dick because I'm the centaur
The porno industry
Wants to pay me lots of money to appear in books and movie
'Cause they think I look funny
But I'm lookin' for true love
Not groupies and freaks
More than a huge cock - I have a complicated mind
I'm not the favorite kind of companion
For the average person
Sometimes things start well
But eventually worsen when sex becomes a problem
Or else they're unimpressed with the attention that you get
Bein' a centaur's love interest
You don't care about my next life
Just my ex-wife and the intimate details of our sex life

Huh, it was some jump boy
I got sunk, kinda baptized on credit
Fishin' down on th' muddy bank
Felt a pull an' give a big yank
I drug out three old rubber boots
A Ford radiator an' a Chevrolet coop

Throw it way out in th' middle of th' hole
Find you a good shady tree and then just set down

And I caught myself a big alligator gar
Drug him home across my back
Tail was dragging a mile and a half
Flippin' an' floppin', I sold him for a quarter

Jumped in the river and went down deep
There was a hundred pound cat-fish lying there asleep
Well, I jumped on his back and rode him all aroun'
Saddled him up and I came into town
People came runnin', lookin', dogs a-barkin'
(Kids a-squallin')
Early one mornin' I took me a notion
To go out fishin' in the middle of the ocean
Well, throwed me a line, I got me a shark
I didn't get him home till way past dark
(Was he a man-eater, tough customer)
(But he wasn't quite tough enough)
Late last night I had me a dream
I was out fishin' in a whiskey stream
Baited my hook with apple-jack
Threw out a drink, drug a gallon back

T.V and magazines,
they'd have you belive, everyday was halloween.
why when I was a kid,
playing in the ditches
living in fear of satan and the witches
the whole world was made of wood and smelled like gasoline
the days were atleast twice as long
and the grass was green.
running for my life
I was cursed by a talking snake
I'd walk all day
and throw rocks across a bottomless lake.
there was a killer in the woods who would whistle
once in a while I could hear him shoot his pistol
and the other kids hated me...
but like a martyr
i drove my self harder and harder
blood in my eyes.
scrubing to get the dirt off
didn't say much didn't like to take my shirt off
was quick
but I didn't know the meaning of pain yet
I'd visit father Bob
and he would show me his train set
tell me a story, offer me a glass of milk
send me on my way with a question to ask myself
the rain didn't bother me
the search had meaning
church was good but I'd rather be dreaming

I no longer feel the need to rush

broken glass all in my mouth
cut wide open and everybody knew why

phil-buck-65,2005,buck-65,Hip-Hop,"20 some years is a long walk
even if it's not in a straight line
you see a lot of things in the distance
y'know what they say about great minds
you and I think about the same things
dream the same dreams play the same games
we started out in the same place,
believe it or not we've got the same names.
Everything happens for a good cause
whether it be victory or loss
and the road may turn into a runway
but you don't know what to do someday
trust me I've seen it all before
I've climbed to the tops of the tallest trees
to get away from the deep water
to find a touch of the smallest breeze
go find the girl with a low voice
who holds the world in her bare hands
you'll fall in love, you'll have no choice
once you are given a fair chance.
For the first time you will sleep well
take a deep breath, see the sun shine
hold on to her for dear life
and then watch the whole world unwind.
Ask her to show you some magic
and I guarantee that she'll say yes
tell her that ""you've seen forever
and we will be together not a day less.""
Just know until that time comes
and after you've crossed that first mile
that the hardest part is behind you
and all of the pain only worth while.
From storm clouds come angels
let pain give you pleasure
from dirt grows the flower
when faith can't be measured."

Driving with a yellow dog, I95
He's got a smile on his face and big shiny eyes
Up at a decent hour, never ate yet
Got a little Johnny Cash in the ol' tape deck
Nothing in the trunk but some base ball gloves
A pair of jumper cables and a set of golf clubs
Blanket on the back seat, we're in rough shape
Sunroof held on with a bit of duct tape
Looking for a gas station, better make a list
Fill'er up with regular, I need to take a piss
Sexy girl air freshener, snacks and that pinwheel
Top up the fluids, clean the bugs off the windshield
Not a care in the world, not a how and a why
No destination, not a cloud in the sky
Back on the road not a moment too soon
Dish ran away with some other spoon

Cough drops, loose change in the beverage holder

Hands like eagle's talons, eyes like hub caps
The further I get, I keep goin' faster
Whispers in the wind and cows in the pasture
I have no plans and nothin' to prove either
I eat out of a bag and sleep in a movie theatre
The highway's a story teller, I just write it down
Already been beaten, there's no way to fight it now
I just kick back and keep warm on the cold days
And laugh 'cause it ain't like it was in the old days
I figure when I make it to the Heavenly gates
They'll be working on my car and playing '78's

craftsmanship,2005,buck-65,Hip-Hop,"Most folks spend their days daydreaming of finding clues
My whole life I've been here at the train station shining shoes
I started when I was nine, on my own and taught myself
No complaints, I'm doing pretty good and I got my health
Memories and callouses, my hearing's probably next to go
Sometimes I do a little handywork for extra dough
But mostly this here is how I spend my time
And I've perfected a technique I call the dry shine
Some guys use lots of water on the shoe but then when it's out in the open air
The shine is gone in 10 minutes
That whole approach to the job is dumb, in fact
Dollars to donuts, that customer won't be coming back
This is the most common mistake of the amateurs
Going for big numbers to satisfy their managers
Anyway, the dry shine, the first thing I mean to do
And this part is very important
I clean the shoe: the residue and old polish
To keep a shoe from being ruined all you need to do is use a rag with some cleaning fluid
If the shoe's all caked up with gunk you need to think
The shoe can't breathe and that's what causes the feet to stink
They took Carfoine off the market, I believe
It was a few years ago, 'cause that leather couldn't breathe
Now once you've cleaned the shoe and it's dried
Your base coat of polish can now be applied
Then you brush, 'cause what that tends to do
Is clean the shoe a little more and gets rid of the residue
And then you do the second coat just like the first one
You brush it, you rag it, and voila, your work is done
And that's it
You treat each shoe like it's special
Care about your work, and be a professional
There's a right way to go about your job and a wrong one
I find this way is much better in the long run
It ain't about the dollar or trying to go fast
Unless you take pride in what you're doing you won't last
Craftsmanship is a quality that some lack
You got to give people a reason for them to come back
The world's a different place than what I was introduced to
They don't wear shineable shoes like they used to
Casual clothes in the office, what is this?
The villain in sneakers is killing my business"
cries-a-girl,2005,buck-65,Hip-Hop,"I was raised on a dirt road ghost town.
Stray dogs, whole nine the gold mine closed down.
I knew the woods like the back of my hand,
And I would shoot the breeze with the roots of trees.
Or go down by the river, watch the way the devil danced,
But never took his hand even though I did have several chances.
Everybody slept when the morning dew turned to frost.
Darkness moved in and somebody burned a cross.
Girl named Stella Kewen was prettier than you'd imagine.
The town should've gave her the crown for the beauty pageant.
But instead, some local pinhead started spreading rumors
About the Kewen's being inbred, and what's worse:
People believed it. The family was dirt poor,
Down on their luck, so that made it hurt more.
Picking up garbage or mowing the grass,
At this point, Stella stopped going to class.
You know how they ridicule a kid in school
And this shit's enough to make anybody feel like a misfit.
She made herself invisible and hid in a house of mirrors.
Whenever the fear stops, so do the teardrops.
Fear is forever, and lies become legend
Growing slowly exponentially.
She should've been a cover girl treated like a princess,
But she's an enigma haunted by the stigma of incest.
Chorus (x2):
She tried to hide the scars;
Her name reminds me of the stars
I saw diamonds dividing
The corners of her eyes
......Stella
......Stella
One horse town known for the most softness.
Little old school house, burned down post office.
Blueberries and bull rushes a tree with a tire(d) swing
Volunteer fireman's affair, the whole entire thing.
Stella was heartbroken, decided to start smoking.
Bad taste in her mouth, she grew into her sad face.
Her few friends were worried, her parents were proud of her.
But she never escaped from under the cloud cover.
A woman reduced, she was eaten by a monster.
And after all these years, a past that still haunts her,
That whispers her name when she's trying instead
To listen to music in her bed.
Now, the story of Stella is one that every child knows,
But the witch in the woods is more like a wild rose.
.......Stella
.......Stella
(Chorus x2)
.......Stella

As a child I used to see little crack vouls
And niggaz sayin how you like me now
Hair to the sky, what you sayin freak I'm fly
Wearin basketball shorts oversized
In the eye's of a boy
Drug dealers really don't struggle
And players go to jail to get muscle
Slide down the pole, if I could be a fireman
You know cursin like the devil when the choir band
No desire man
Just a care free boy
Throwin fizzy foul get a toy
In the eye's of a child, cartoons are just like Jesus
If you don't beleive this, man you should see this
As a child, a kid is a pout
And you put him in your memory voul, but right now"

my-wishes-equipto,2004,andre-nickatina,Hip-Hop,"[Verse 1 - Andre Nickatina]
Picture a blind man that can't see
Meaning the beauty he's supposed to see
God it can't be
I thizz alone like a snake, the venom I spit make me shake
Look at the cakes I baked
Weed in my brain got me baptized
Unless you talkin' bout money, you ain't sayin' shit rap wise
I'm so addicted to red licorice and fine bitches
Khan lives forever man that's my wishes
[Verse 2 - Equipto]
My wishes, we owe intense wishes
Bruce Lee, Tupac, and Jimmy Hendrix Peter Tosh
still here to leagalize it, with no police around to ever read they rights
It's how I roll, you know my lifestyle is cold
Around the globe, they treat us like Al Capone
Wish I didn't need a blunt in my mouth to blow
But I'm so far gone that's how it go
[Verse 3 - Andre Nickatina]
Yeah, two wishes and three bitches in the Cadillac
They wanna hit the club but this is where the party's at
Front line and in ya face like some gold teeth
My homie said he's like a butcher cause he loves beef
raw pipes and two doors on the cutty
I had to laugh at him, cause that's my buddy
We used to chase bitches so vicious it was delicious
I heard a lil' genie sayin ""Take more wishes""
[Verse 4 - Equipto]
Wishin', why listen to a fool really give a fuck
Don't interrupt you stupid you know I already hit the blunt
We get ta cuttin' like a DJ do
The game's sheisty like a NFL replay booth
In your backpack party with all my throwbacks on
Suckas stare like they're impressed, sayin ""Oh my god""
There go the whole bank wadd
...just keep 'em playin' to win
I'm in to win, I'm wishin but I couldn't pretend
[Verse 5 - Andre Nickatina]
Shit, I side swipe you in the light just like a fender bender
There go your brain with the game so you don't remember
I'm block tonic off the chronic and I spit ebonics
Colt 45 in my eyes, so it get hypnotic
The glock nine, some use it like a samuari
Run for your lives, or picture being paralized
I hold my raps with a grip of a rubber handle
Then when I'm gone man you picture it on every channel
In grey flannel, Nicky bust a name belt
When I was scarred by the game and the pain felt,
Excruciating, no duplicatin' this fury
Look at the lawyer with a grin for the hung jury
Four wishes, more wishes, man and more bitches
Man more weed, more G's, man and club bitches
The rap scriptures, we hold them like the bible
Imagine somebody shootin' at your idol
...(? sun like Clorox make it fade
Bust it 27 ways, we did it right away
Sneak weed up in heaven with the switches
Eatin' red licorice and lyin' with the bitches
I hate to do dishes, in love with my riches
Man it ain't suspicious why you sleepin' with the fishes
These are my wishes, I got five wishes
Prime time live, gettin' high off my wishes"

no angels guide me i seem to be lost
spittin a rhyme from divious ways
all in the veins them freaks they get paid
the path was layed the bed was set
nicky the cat from the fillmoe jets
here go the stealo it aint that odd
kahn, money, clothes, broads
don't forget weed and rap for the gods
pages that rewrite the holy karahn
man i've been swervin since julius erving
ready to rap now so open the curtain
don't be in the lab when i'm doin bad
pencil's and pads they turn to cash
this how i mash
driving so fast
shoes say wu when i step on the gas
baby is mad
man she got ass
i looked and gave her my gangsta laugh
my pedigree my legacy
i sell it like aphetimines
they told me at the dinner scene
and i'm standing there high in my anchor jean
gangsta's, hustlers, hoe's and all
feel the pain when a rapper falls
blood in my hair from the wings of a hawk
no angels guide me i seem to be lost
its mighty extreme to being a king
looking for people to be on the team
how much money it cost to cheat
to slow ya down and be drug free
with kenneth cole boots and sean john suits
and execution that top of the roof
who got the juice
show me some proof
the curser the rhyme give me the loot
awake like an owl and drinkin some tea
watchin fights of muhamud ali
dodgin death with every step
this is my rep give me the checks
like snaggle puss i'll step to the left
with this freak but that quiet is kept
my philisophy is tha boss of me
pass the hot sauce to me
you need diamonds and pearls to floss with me
i stand there with none
hot as a gun
the sound of the noise will make you run
move from the slugs that will rip your lungs
look in the eyes of the greediest god
rollin the streets with the cadi facade
cut through the rain like ninja blades
the batter ramming slang the rage
i got my games from project floors
weed, dope, and dice by the door
crush anything that'll cause a threat
talk to the bookie secure the bet
never with leniency he won't agree with me
gettin all mad when i make the call
gangsta's, hustlas, hoes, and all
feel the pain when a rapper falls
blood in my hair from the wings of a hawk
no angels guide me i seem to be lost"

City after city time and crime rap dealer
I don't play football, I'm not a playmaker
My only way deep is to throw a haymaker
School rule breaker
Makin' teachers have a fit
From the Goz show that's how I learn to spit
Man, some All Star Chuck's and some coke to sack
It don't matter what color as long it blue or black
Cuz I'm reckless
Cuban necklace
Never in the game that become wet fish
Two t-shirts an ah adidas suit
Man, I ain't peepin' what what ya speakin'
Homie gimme the loot
Man, you filled wit' truth
And I'm filled with lies
When we rap all these muthfuckas' die despise
Like the sparrow that narrow
Nigga shootin' through an arrow
You can see the klugg's if you look through the barrel
Fools use chess like a VCR
Worth as much as a CD-R
Gotta put my hands in the cookie jar
You got beef?
Let my rap den rip ya car
Disappear like a motherfuckin' desert mirage
Smellin' so good like a red crosage
That's the way I fuck em' down
Climbs around by sound
Like how them whistles whip through the ground
Get the camera, the ramela, the scramela
Two points the fuck with the camela, SIN
Who cares what mood ya in?
It'll sound like thunda if I lose again
Yeah nickatina I dun told ya the virgin of fame
Im like napoleon you beat like he come in the game
Check's is ready to name
Then I pop the brain
Ain't a law in the world that can stop the case
I wear Adidas
Sometimes Fillas
They're the two leadas'
The boy king
Hit yo bowl, sack, low jeans
At 3am
Yeah the freeway mine
And you can tell by the ticket's I've left behind
You wanna get reckless?
Don't get checklist
Cops motherfucker they respect this
What's on the wishlist?
Man, I can get this
I freak with big lips
And she love the tongue kiss
And cold as a tundre
Seven's the numba
Split up the pie
Or chop it like lumba
Don't forget the thunda that I said
And all praises to Bob Marley's mighty dreads
We need to find someone to hunt down
Think of the turn around
The murder is murder round
Tryin to burn em' down
Reckless
I all blessed it
I hit the stage freak with such freshness
Two t-shirts and ah adidas suit
Im lookin' way too cute
You bitches raise the roof
You got bacardi in ya' body
180 proof
And I'm addicted to ya ass
Like ya' name was truth
I jump in the coop
With a couple of bloods
And bitch fuck ya party if the shit don't bump
Because I'm major fast
I need major cash
And damn your sister got major ass
Homie reckless
They won't respect this

Check it, load me up and then cock me back
Then come right back with the counter rap
He's bustin raps till he collapse
Or at least until his chest plate crack

I ain't one of these bitch ass niggas
that ain't from the town that spit what he don't do
But I'ma let him bumble a little more then I'ma hip all my niggas to you
You lyin about tryna be high that ain't fire that you spittin
Purple haze a fake crook get cooked and burnt
and baked the fuck up in Hell's Kitchen
I ain't one of these bitch ass niggas

I know at his next show he'll be slipping, 'cause his guns ain't clicking
He tryna shine like stadium lights I'ma leave this nigga ice dripping
With some real heat star 6-70
For a bitch ass Hollywood nigga that wanna become a star that's heavenly
It's not hard, you can depend on me,
Serving niggas like you, I'm the epitome
Only difference I don't drink much
And mothafuckas get deeply touched
That think I give a fuck tryna get money
but shit if you gotta get hit I'll dump your face off
Have your ass under the Astroturf of some shit
Crack that weak Halloween mask
and stab your ass in a pumpkin, I'm dumping
West Oakland...Saaf Bizzle...

ayo,2002,andre-nickatina,Hip-Hop,"OK.. got some for me?
(San Quinn)
Yeah, yeah, listen to the story I'm about to tell
Another tale about that yayo
Little girl once innocent and sweet
14 introduced to the street
Started from weed, big smoke outs
before you could exhale, blunt in your mouth
Champ, Nade, blue you blew
now you need something else to do
A new high to try, a new place to go
introduced to the yay to the yo
House full of girls, old and young
blade on the table takin one on ones
Use dollar bills just to snort the line
you see the big girls do it so of
course it's fine
Cocaine enforced on your mind
Now you're blowed, and you're blowin ya time
Let's go
(Andre Nickatina)
Ayo for yayo
Walk around with yayo, all in my nasal
I must have been crazed yo
Ayo for yayo
Walk around with yayo, all in my nasal
I must have been crazed yo
(San Quinn)
Choppin and coppin the kicks, supplyin people with they fix
Where you fit?
On Fillmore Street is where you sit
Don't go in the house till you move a zip
Work the day, and night shift
To stay awake, a nigga might sniff
not too much 'cause you might slip
Instead of 28, you could get 26
Keep a gat and a pack in the sock
take a couple of toots, then its back to the block
Back to the surface out the sack
experimentin with that soft, wonderin about that crack, huh
One try, another try without a doubt
papered out, always at the powder house
Day time, night time, nigga powdered out
coulda been a papered up power house
(Andre Nickatina)
Ayo for yayo
Walk around with yayo, all in my nasal
I must have been crazed yo
Ayo for yayo
Walk around with yayo, all in my nasal
I must have been crazed yo
(San Quinn)
Like you and I, super high, like Superfly
one more line, one more rhyme like Peruvian fine
I can keep you down, or get you high
You like the blow, like Boston George? You want some more, for you and whores?
I kick off wars, and get behind walls
and corporate doors, executive nose sore
Rich man high, eight balls and quarters
they call me, placin they orders
Bring me across the border, buyin the cake
before I'm sold, they take a taste
Snortin, habit, not worth affordin
some use me, strictly out of boredom
I hooked people before man, I warned them
I took many people out before them
Doin my job, connected with the mob
got President Bush, Whitney, and Bob
Many others all walks of life have one on ones with me every night
(Andre Nickatina)
Ayo for yayo
Walk around with yayo, all in my nasal
I must have been crazed yo
Ayo for yayo
Walk around with yayo, all in my nasal

Go ahead Romeo do your thing.
Early one morning with a freaky ho* tapped on her shoulder said lets go
She turned around and said oh no
Imma start bloating like benicio
Early one morning with a freaky dame
A different broad but its all the same
She said she know how to f*ck and I'm to blame
Woulda said something back but forgot her name
Games gonn come and get you
Bring the camera with you
The photographer with the nudey pictures
A little old trick from my boy pat rich
She said I ain't no groupie ho*
I said see E. Already knows
Girls want to try and act straight and square
But super freaks in their underwear
Walken just like Christopher
Tossin to get rid of her
Smoov is the way I act
And like Jackpot I'm a play boy Mack
Back to the first night it was Hennessy
On the second it was just you and me
The third my vision was blurred
I don't recall understanding a word
Panties hanging from the light fixture
She stare all day at my yearbook picture
Whispers right off my shoulder
My spit gets raw as my age gets older
Flousey is what you are
Doobie smoke broke out my car
Spit this game like a moccasin
Get this broad then floss again
Early one morning with a freaky ho* she turned around and said oh no
I need to get to Sebastopol
Early one morning with a freaky dame
A different broad but its all the same
She said she know how to f*ck and I'm to blame
Woulda said something back but forgot her name
E's gonn smoke heavily breathe deep till your lungs bleed
Ooh I don't run in the game
But gangsta when I do my thang
Change like a dollar bill
Strange tell you how to feel
Tame but it's so real
Keep my ho*s rotating like a steering wheel
It's like crazy when you look at me
It's like baby who you trying to be
Lazy when you hit the weed
It's a whole nother story when you're hanging with E.
Keep her brain on spin like a ceiling fan
Keep my donkey swole it's supply in demand
Gotta be the man get to spittin
Try another broad out, don't know what you're missin
Got a whole notebook full of game, game
Got a roladex full of b*tches, b*tches
Got a big black book full of names, names
If I showed it to you you'd think its vicious, vicious
Got a whole clipboard full of game
And a big black book where you can write your name
They all the same but know what I'm about
And ready for whatever E dish out
Some ho*s think we made from mud
But I know its muscle and blood
Grab your piece like nick and pack it quick
Got a call from my b*tch gotta give
I'm the big jimmy D. sausage King
Like frank white so much heat to bring
I want a bad b*tch with no limitations
I'm a big bad wolf when it comes to relations
Mouthpiece like this you know I score
""Sixteen tons"" like Ernie Ford
I pop like a mule, hit like a bat
Nothing like listening to that gangsta rap
I flow so smooth call me water vore
She f*ck so good see I taught her boy
It only took a few lines for me to bag it
I bet you didn't know I'm a p*ssy addict
It's a good thing I got groupies to catch
That'll make p*ssy gum or p*ssy patch
Don't get attached if you're feeling lucky
I still can't f*ck without my rubber ducky"

july-the-4th-andre-nickatina,2002,andre-nickatina,Hip-Hop,"How should I start? I'm so confused
By now I'm sure you heard the news
Cats I got workin' on the block,
Got a plot for me to stop
In my heart, I can't even say they wrong
'cause in the game all the playas sing the same song
I have seen cats do back flips when the bullets hit
Had to go and bring Jesus in they life
Counterfeit to the pulpit
But anyway
I'm so loved and hated 'round the community
My mother wonder what money, drugs can do to me
I swear to God, I seen the Devil in my bag of weed
Where you live, I might freeze,
Gotta get this cheese
Cats is makin' side deals with these other dealers
And slappin' five with a player
Man, like I'm they nigga
I paged Nickatina, he didn't call me back
He must be on tour, but I'm not sure
But once again, it's July the 4th
And once again
God I'm goin' to war, for sure
'There's gonna be fighting,
And somebody's gonna get hurt, that's for sure'
.... 'And everything we worked for will be wiped out
And I don't think we can let that happen,
I mean that makes sense'
Man I taught these cats how to move this coke
Taught these cats about the weed they smoke
Took they mind from bein' broke
Now they wanna have me smoked?
My woman said to me, 'her or my friends?'
I said my friends 'cause we bowed our ends
She said, nigga please
Them muthaf**kas is ya enemies
Baby I love you but I gots ta leave
Because you don't sleep
Some nights man, you don't even eat
Smokin' weed, nigga,
Runnin' the streets
But check it, I don't complain
I hate the fact her face is stuck in my brain
It's like razors just to hear her name
Put that on double glocks
The beef is burnin' every tick of the clock
Even the rain won't stop the plot
Got a page from Nickatina
But right when I was 'bout to call him back
My windshield had suddenly cracked,
from the impact
Gave shotty, glass half cut off my body
I can recognize the shooter,
It was little Shotty
And I gave that muthaf**ka, yea his name,
He tryna' to take a cat out the game
Yo, I'm full of blood (?)
You know bullets give you hot love
I go in shock from the heat of the slug
I think I'm 'bout to die
This is my last time to testify
And after that there was no reply
Put that on double glocks (Shit)

'I didn't'"

Had to compliment her on her fresh done nails

No pickles, no onions, no playin'
Check this out no delayin'

Talkin' to a beezy on the phone but can't hear her
Turned down the bump, so I can hear clearer
I hear sirens get nearer
Red and blue lights in my rear view mirror
Pull over, nope nope
With a car full of smoke and trunk full of dope
I hit the gasser, go faster
All you hear is dual exhaust, flowmaster
On a chase, I take 'em, then I shake 'em

And I sport new clothes on you MC fine hoes
I locate like transmitters

The highest mountain,
If you would fulfill the promise to be mine oh mine
I would swim, the seven seas
If we could sit down and talk about us
And agree to agree
I would walk without water
Across the death of sand
To here you say you're ready to be in love again
People are talking, trying to build us apart
They can't see the love in our hearts
Girl I care about you and you care about me
And if we believe in each other
We goin' be alright, yes we will
We goin' be alright, alright

nowhere,2005,112,Hip-Hop,"If ever you wondered
If ever you were nervous about it
You gotta know,
I ain't never,
Lemme say that again,
I ain't never, goin' nowhere
Listen to me
Last night I almost cried when you told me
That you think you love me more than I love you
Sometimes it hurts to carry that burden alone
Lets be clear and get a few things straight
No ones ever gonna take your place in my heart
Nothing can measure the love that I've got for you
I'm telling you
When I'm out in the club at night
You don't have to worry about a thing
'cause I ain't goin' nowhere, I ain't goin' nowhere,
So my heart is telling me that you are the one
that I'm gon be with for the rest of my life
And I ain't goin' nowhere
I know you've heard it all before
You don't have to worry no more
'cause I ain't goin' nowhere
Baby just trust me
As long as you love me
I ain't never goin' nowhere
I was lost and abandoned
Searching for the truth
Looking for that missing one
That missing one was you
The road was so tough
But you gave it up
until I found you and you made it
Worth the wait and worth the years
Worth the strength and worth the tears
And you don't know the half of it
But baby here's the rest of it
Did you know that your a gift far brighter than the sun?
Did you know that your a blessing, and I'm the lucky one
Did you know that I could never ask for a better love
Did you know that I would die, before I broke your heart
Did you know that if you left me, my world would fall apart
And never come back together, baby that's for real
So the next time that you tell me, you'll remember this
When I'm out in the club at night
You don't have to worry about a thing
'cause I ain't goin' nowhere, I ain't goin' nowhere,
So my heart is telling me that you are the one
that I'm gon be 'with for the rest of my life
And I ain't goin nowhere
I know you've heard it all before
You don't have to worry no more
'cause I ain't goin' nowhere
Baby just trust me
As long as you love me
I ain't never goin' nowhere
When I'm out in the club at night
You don't have to worry about a thing
'cause I ain't goin' nowhere, I ain't goin' nowhere,
So my heart is telling me that you are the one
that I'm gon be with for the rest of my life
And I ain't goin' nowhere
I know you've heard it all before
You don't have to worry no more
'cause I ain't goin' nowhere
Baby just trust me
As long as you love me
I ain't never goin' nowhere"
my-mistakes,2005,112,Hip-Hop,"[Chorus]
If I could erase, everyone of my mistakes
Tell me would it make you want to come over
And work this out with me
And I'd do whatever it takes just meet me half way
All I want is for you to come over and work this out(work this out)with me.
What's wrong with me, why can't I do right
You promised me you'd give me your life
If I could be more then just a typical
Guy to lie to your face
How could I do, the things that I said I wouldn't do
Give them the same, I give to you
Am I just a pitiful franken as your worth-(Not sure what it says there lol.)
You told me that before
Promised that I wouldn't go there no more
You gave me all of you, but what did I go do
And every time I had a chance to get into another niggas woman's pants
I would follow through, not thinking of me and you
[Chorus]
If I could erase, everyone of my mistakes
Tell me would it make you want to come over
And work this out with me
And I'd do whatever it takes just meet me half way
All I want is for you to come over and work this out(work this out)with me.
As bad as I want you right here,
Empathize with the way that you feel,
Took away the things, that you called your kids(I'm so sorry baby I'm needing you)
If you can find the feeling you had from the start you know we should never be apart
I'm asking can you to please listen to me
Well you told me that before
Promised that I wouldn't go there no more
You gave me all of you, but what did I go do
And every time I had a chance to get into another niggas woman's pants
I would follow through, not thinking of me and you

Tell me would it make you want to come over

Well I want you to come over and talk to me
I know I don't deserve to be apart of anyone tryin' to give me their heart (but I'm in need)
Baby please, come on over and talk to me
I see you lookin' like I've seen you look before
'Cause your the only one to show me real love(I'm in need)

If I could erase, everyone of my mistakes
Tell me would it make you want to come over

Want to let you go, I just want to find a way to work it out
We've been through so much, good and bad times
Girl I did you wrong, you forgave me then we tried to start over
I apologized tried to make it right, so many times
Now I think its time to let this go

And even though I love you and you've been with me for so long
And we thought that we could make it work but we were wrong
But neither one of us want to be the first to say goodbye
Baby I think its time to let this go
Girl it's hard for me to tell you that it's over
I hate feeling this way
But I know you know things just haven't been the same
We always said that we, we would tell the truth
No matter what it is, can't continue to pretend our heart is in it
I'm waiting for you to see, the reality
We at dead end, there no way to go unless we gonna to be just friends
I love you so much, never thought that I would ever have to say
That I think its time to let this go

Oh girl
What happened to the love
What happen to the girl
The girl I fell in love with

Without the root, you ain't got no tree
And without the branches, you ain't got no leaves
To understand her is to understand me
Cause that's how close we are
Without a sea, you ain't got no air
And it ain't no walking if you ain't got the legs
Understand I use them eyes to see
That's how close we are
Heart to heart
Breath to Breath
She fills me up till there ain't none left
No space, no time
Her sprits my mind
You see that's how close we are
That's how close we are (X2)
Without the stars, there's no galaxy
And without the river, you don't have no sea
Just look at my life, and it's her you'll see
Cause that's how close we are
And without a voice no one could hear you sing
And it ain't flying without the wings
So when you see me flying
It's her carrying me
That's how close we are
Chorus
She talks with me
She walks with me
She's holding me
And yes, She's teaching me
Everything I can't do
Everything I can't say
She does for m
She prays with me
She cries with me
She's loving me
Nothing could compare to the love we share
So that woman and man
Who understands you can say:

That's how close we are (x10)"

why-cant-we-get-along,2005,112,Hip-Hop,"Is it me,
Who never compromise,
I only see things through my eyes,
Which means is my way?
Or is it you
Who's always shutting down,
Never wanting to talk about the problems we got?
Or is it we to blame for all that's going down?
I say that I love you but we can't work it out.
It's making us not want to stay around.
We need to sit down and ask ourselves.
Why can't we (why can't we)
Why can't we get along
When we know we can't be away from each other for long?
Why can't we (why can't we)
Why can't we get along

Why can't I look at you
And see your point of view
And take the back seat?
Is it true
That I'm so unreasonable

If it's me then baby tell me
You don't have to ignore, you don't want this anymore
Just don't let me be the last to know

Cause nowadays you got a new attitude
And you barely answer my calls and when I finally get through
You rush of the line like I don't matter to you
Was it something I said, girl what did I do
If there's a problem it ain't hard for us to work it out
There's no difference from what we've been through before
I can't move on and I won't until we make it better

If I Hit
Promise
I ain't gotta hear nothing from ya
Yo nigga riding up with that drama
Saying I done cut this woman
If I Hit
Promise
There ain't gonna be no drama
Tell you yet, Ã¢??cause I think I love Ã¢??em
'Cause you let me bend that over
If I Hit
Body sick
Gotta come here with me
112
We can hit
Body thick
Gon' be tripping with me"
god-knows,2005,112,Hip-Hop,"Baby tell me why, why do you question
All this love that I have for you
If you look into my eyes you'll make an exception
I will show you love like no one before
Put your trust in me, allow me to be there
Baby give me your hand to hold
Cause the feelings that I have are so complicated
That words cannot explain there is only one who knows
[Chorus]
Only God knows how much I love you
God sees my heart and that it cares about you
God knows that I'm thinking of you
And I'm longing for you, how I wish that you knew what God Knows
Baby tell me what, what is the reason
One good reason you're so insecure
Cause after all that I have done
I think you should know by now
Girl I'm down for you and the love I have is pure
I want to help you understand just how I feel for you
You're the one that I can't let go
Because the feeling that I have is so complicated
That words cannot explain there is only one who knows
[Chorus: x2]
And all of my lonely days, only God knows how lonely
And oh the sleepless nights baby, only God sees me cry
And every time I think of you, only God can read my mind
God knows I tried to help you understand
And Heaven knows I miss you
Only God can see how much
Cause every time you go away, I long for your touch
And when I say I love you girl, only God sees my heart
He sees my heart, only God knows
[Chorus]"
